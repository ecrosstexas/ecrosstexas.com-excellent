Healthy doctrines of justification and regeneration have always been essential to the Christian's faith and knowledge of God. In the context of 18th century Great Britain and its American Colonies, few treatments were as highly regarded as John Witherspoon's An Essay on Justification and A Practical Treatise on Regeneration, both reprinted in this volume.

Providing a careful summary of Witherspoon's life and thought, Kevin DeYoung's introduction and notes are an invaluable guide to these classic works. Justification and Regeneration is both milk and solid food for the Christian–an incisive study of the converted person's standing before God, along with a pastoral exploration of the power of that conversion.
