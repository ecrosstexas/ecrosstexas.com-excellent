The Reformed Forum Theology Conference was held at Hope Orthodox Presbyterian Church in Grayslake, Illinois on October 7, 2023. The conference theme was “100 Years of Christianity and Liberalism: J. Gresham Machen’s Theological Legacy.” The occasion was the one-hundredth anniversary of the publication of J. Gresham Machen’s Christianity and Liberalism. Conference speakers Camden Bucey, Jim Cassidy, Lane Tipton, and D. G. Hart took the opportunity to consider Machen’s unique contributions by exploring several covenantal, eschatological, and historical themes that intersect with his work.
