## BOOK DESCRIPTION

Most evangelical Christians know of Matthew Henry’s _Commentary on the Bible_, but few are as familiar with his _A Method for Prayer, with Scripture Expressions Proper to Be Used under Each Head_. This work consists almost entirely of Scripture, arranged under various headings, to help Christians to pray in harmony with the truth of God, revealed in his Word.

### REVISED AND UPDATED

First published three hundred years ago, it has been revised and updated by O. Palmer Robertson to allow the language of prayer to be expressed in today’s idiom. It is sent out in the confidence that God will continue to honour his own Word, as it is redirected back to him in the form of heartfelt prayer.
