description: Why would Christians baptize infants? Jason Helopoulos lays out the Reformed perspectiveâ€” the logic of baptism flows from a covenant-keeping God, who loves to bless his people. Informative and encouraging, this brief book will serve as a helpful primer and quick reference tool for parents, congregations, elders, and pastors.
