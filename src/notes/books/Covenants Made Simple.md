description: "Jonty Rhodes guides us in an engaging study of covenant theology and why it matters. With clarity and wit, he shows us how covenants carry the Bibleâ€™s story from start to finish and ultimately give root to the gospel of salvation by grace. Beginning with Adam in the garden of Eden, and ending with Jesus, our risen Covenant King, Rhodes illuminates the good news of a promise-making, promise-keeping God."
