## Description

What do the various covenants given throughout the Bible mean to us? Are they relevant to our lives? A rainbow now and then may remind us of God’s promise to Noah, and we’ve memorized the part about the new covenant in Jesus’ blood at communion—but do we dig any deeper? Do we need to? 

Jonty Rhodes guides us in an engaging study of covenant theology and why it matters. With clarity and wit, he shows us how covenants carry the Bible’s story from start to finish and ultimately give root to the gospel of salvation by grace. Beginning with Adam in the garden of Eden, and ending with Jesus, our risen Covenant King, Rhodes illuminates the good news of a promise-making, promise-keeping God.

Key topics include law and grace, union with Christ, baptism in the Spirit, predestination, and water baptism. Rediscover the Bible’s unified covenantal story and its unfolding message throughout Scripture.
