Did you know that the preaching of the Word of God has unique sin-killing, life-giving power—and brings great blessing to those who hear and receive it? In this helpful primer for congregations, Pastor David Strain establishes the basic biblical and theological foundations of preaching, highlights historical examples, and responds to questions, fears, and objections about expositional preaching in a Reformed church.

Written for the church, the Blessings of the Faith series introduces and celebrates Reformed doctrine and practice—each book features a brief and practical overview of its topic with discussion questions and an extensive Q&A section.
