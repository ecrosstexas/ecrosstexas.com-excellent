## Description:

**Bestselling Author Rosaria Butterfield Confronts 5 Cultural Lies She Once Believed**

Modern culture is increasingly outspoken against a biblical understanding of what it means to be a woman. Even some Christians, swayed by the LGBTQ+ movement, have rejected God’s word on issues of sexuality and gender in favor of popular opinion. In light of these pressures, it’s more important than ever to help women see the truth about who God created them to be.  
  
In this powerful book, Rosaria Butterfield uses Scripture to confront 5 common lies about sexuality, faith, feminism, gender roles, and modesty often promoted in our secular culture today. Written in the style of a memoir, this book explores Butterfield’s personal battle with these lies—interwoven with cultural studies, literary criticism, and theology—to help readers see the beauty in biblical womanhood, marriage, and motherhood.

- **Culturally Relevant:** Confronts controversial topics including transgenderism, homosexuality, feminism, spirituality, and modesty from a Bible-centered perspective
- **Written for Christian Women:** Inspires women to preserve godly values around womanhood, marriage, and motherhood in their lives, and offers guidance as they shepherd the next generation
- **By Rosaria Butterfield:** Bestselling author of _The Gospel Comes with a House Key_ (100,000+ copies sold) and _The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert_ (100,000+ copies sold)
- **Filled with Personal Stories:** Rosaria speaks from her own experience as a formerly militant anti-Christian and outspoken feminist, in order to teach and encourage other Christians

## Notes:

In all the interviews with Rosaria I've seen, she says this book is geared towards "moms and grandmas," but the truths are applicable to everyone.

### 3 Reasons

- We have failed to see that the seeds of the gospel are in the garden (We've denied that the creation ordinance found in Genesis 1:27 has any bearing on evangelism).
- We don't seem to know what time we're living in (We've failed to see that the three exchanges of Romans 1 have taken root in both civil and federal law).
- We're really sloppy with our categories (confused becoming friends with the enemy with loving the enemy).

### 5 Lies

- Lie #1: Homosexuality Is Normal
- Lie #2: Being a Spiritual Person Is Kinder than Being a Biblical Christian
- Lie #3: Feminism Is Good for the World and the Church
- Lie #4: Transgenderism Is Normal
- Lie #5: Modesty Is an Outdated Burden That Serves Male Dominance and Holds Women Back
