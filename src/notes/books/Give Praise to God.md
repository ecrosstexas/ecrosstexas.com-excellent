This call for the doxological reformation of the church is offered to “ministers who lead their congregations in worship, musicians who seek a deeper understanding of the spiritual purpose of their work, [and] seminary students who are clarifying their commitment to biblical worship. . . .”  
  
Give Praise to God continues the legacy of James Montgomery Boice by examining the biblical foundations for worship, the warranted elements of corporate worship, worship in the home and in all of life, and worship throughout the ages.
