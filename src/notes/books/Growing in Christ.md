**Description**

**A Clear Outline of Basic Christianity from Theologian J. I. Packer**

Followers of Christ grow spiritually by learning and living out the essentials of their faith, which are often taken for granted or overlooked in daily life. Renowned theologian J. I. Packer believed that Christianity is not automatic and must be learned by new believers and mature Christians alike. 

In _Growing in Christ_, Packer offers readers an easy-to-follow road map for studying theological topics, including the Apostles’ Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and baptism. Each chapter helps both new and lifelong believers examine what Packer calls “the intellectual ABCs” of the gospel so they can grow in faith.

- **Covers Christian Themes in Depth:** Including Christian convictions, communion with God, and code of conduct
- **Great for Individual or Group Study:** Each chapter ends with study questions and Bible passages
- **Accessible:** Written for Christians of all backgrounds and denominations, as well as the newly converted
