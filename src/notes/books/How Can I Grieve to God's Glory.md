description: Some believers feel guilty when they grieve because they know that they should rejoice in the Lord always (Phil. 4:4). Others use grief as an occasion to say, like Job, “God hath overthrown me” (Job 19:6). Yet there is a better and more biblical path to follow. Using Lamentations 3:1–39 as a guide, Ryan M. McGraw furnishes readers with the necessary tools to grieve in a sanctified way and exercise faith under hardship. Come and learn to express rather than repress your grief as you walk through sorrows with Christ by faith.
