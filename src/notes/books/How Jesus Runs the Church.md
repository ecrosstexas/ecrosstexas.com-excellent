There are many fine books available on the offices of church leadership. Few, if any, address for a contemporary audience the biblical foundations of the _government_ of the church. But this should be a priority for us, because God emphasizes the government of his church throughout Scripture.

Why should we be church members? How do church officers reflect Jesus’ reign over us? Where do the church’s responsibilities begin and end? Where do ours? These, and other important questions, are answered in Guy Prentiss Water’s vital examination of _How Jesus Runs the Church_.

At a time when church authority is treated with contempt, it’s important that we honor God in our churches more than ever.
