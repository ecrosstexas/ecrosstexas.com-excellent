**Description**

It is evident why Boston’s work enjoyed such popularity. So basic is his material, and so thorough his presentation of it, the Human Nature in its fourfold State speaks to the spiritual needs of every reader.  For those who ask about the origin and meaning of human existence, Boston provides the biblical answer; for those who are confused about the Christian gospel, Boston explains its meaning and its power.
