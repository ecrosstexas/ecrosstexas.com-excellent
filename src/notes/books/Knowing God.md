_Knowing God_ by J. I. Packer is a modern Christian classic. Since its original publication in 1973, Packer’s insightful and practical approach has impacted countless Christians throughout the world as they are introduced to the wonder and joy of knowing God. 

In this beloved work, Packer challenges readers that while they may know _about_ God, it is not the same thing as _knowing_ him. Organized into 3 sections, _Knowing God_ explains the importance of theological study of the Lord, what the Bible has to say about God and his character, and the benefits of knowing him. From cover to cover, Packer teaches that each truth learned about God should ultimately lead to prayer and praise.

- Accessible: Written for Christians of all backgrounds and denominations, as well as new believers
- Practical and Insightful: Addresses many common questions about faith, including _Who needs theology?_, _What does it mean to be adopted into the family of God?_, and _Can God communicate his plan to us?_ 
- Beautiful Hardcover Edition: Perfect for a lifetime of reading and for giving as a gift
- Written by Bestselling Author J. I. Packer: His other books include _Growing in Christ_; _A Quest for Godliness_; _Rediscovering Holiness_; and more
