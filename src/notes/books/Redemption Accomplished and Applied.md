description: The atonement is the very center of the Christian faith. The free and sovereign love of God is the source of the accomplishment of redemption, as the Bible's most familiar text makes clear. "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." For thoughtful Christians since the time of the Apostle Paul, this text has started, not ended, the discussion of redemption. But few recent interpreters have explored the biblical passages dealing with the necessity, nature, perfection, and extent of the atonement as penetratingly or precisely as Professor Murray. Part II of this book deals with the distinct steps to be identified in the Bible's presentation of how the redemption accomplished by Christ is applied progressively to the life of the redeemed. Here are helpful expositions of the scriptural teachings about calling, regeneration, faith and repentance, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, union with Christ, and glorification.

Originally published in 1955 and reprinted dozens of times over the years, John Murray’s Redemption Accomplished and Applied systematically explains the two sides of redemption -- its accomplishment through Christ’s atonement and its application to the lives of believers.
