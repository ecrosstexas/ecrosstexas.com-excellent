This volume contains selected doctrinal documents of the Christian faith as confessed throughout the history of Presbyterian and Reformed churches of Jesus Christ to the present day. Although not equal in authority to inspired revelation, we believe these documents to be faithful summaries of Christian doctrine as taught by Holy Scripture. It is with this in mind that we have prepared this edition expressly for the use of students at Westminster Theological Seminary. However, it is our hope that the quality and portability of the book, along with its pertinent selections of creeds and confessions, will make it immediately useful for broader application―supplementing and serving the worship and study of Christ’s church.” The historic texts which comprise this volume include: Ecumenical creeds: The Apostles’ Creed, The Nicene Creed, The Chalcedonian Definition, and The Athanasian Creed The Westminster Standards: The Westminster Confession of Faith, The Westminster Larger Catechism, and The Westminster Shorter Catechism The Three Forms of Unity: The Belgic Confession, The Heidelberg Catechism, and The Canons of the Synod of Dort The Second Helvetic Confession Visit standards.
