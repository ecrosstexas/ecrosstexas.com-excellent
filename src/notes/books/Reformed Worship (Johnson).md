description: "Reformed Worship follows the release earlier this year of the same author s Worshipping with Calvin. This is a much shorter and more accessible presentation of the subject: Terry Johnson shows clearly that there are good biblical and historical reasons why the worship of the Reformed church needs to be shaped in a particular way."

The Reformers and Puritans believed that how we worship is just as important as how we are saved. They taught this because they understood (perhaps better than any Christians who ever lived) that the way worship, to a large extent, determines the God we worship. This is why biblical worship is always the response of the redeemed to God's initiative of self-revelation.   
  
If we worship according to our own imaginations and traditions, we will worship (at least to some degree) a God of our own imagination. But when we worship according to God's own instruction, we worship the God who is - the only true God.
