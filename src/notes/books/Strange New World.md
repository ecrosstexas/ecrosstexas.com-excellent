**From Philosophy to Technology, Tracing the Origin of Identity Politics**

How did the world arrive at its current, disorienting state of identity politics, and how should the church respond? Historian Carl R. Trueman shows how influences ranging from traditional institutions to technology and pornography moved modern culture toward an era of “expressive individualism.” Investigating philosophies from the Romantics, Nietzsche, Marx, Wilde, Freud, and the New Left, he outlines the history of Western thought to the distinctly sexual direction of present-day identity politics and explains the modern implications of these ideas on religion, free speech, and personal identity. 

For fans of Trueman’s _The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self_, _Strange New World_ offers a more concise presentation and application of some of the most critical topics of our day. Individuals and groups can work through the book together with the _Strange New World Study Guide_ and _Strange New World Video Study_, sold separately.

- **A Concise Version of _The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self_:** Offers an approachable presentation of the points in Trueman’s popular book
- **A Great Resource for Individual and Small-Group Study:** Each chapter ends with thought-provoking application questions
