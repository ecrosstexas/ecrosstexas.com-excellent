Caring for your pastor and the difference it makes.

What do you think about your pastor? Do you chew over his sermons and wonder if they are clear and helpful? Do you feel he spends enough time with you? In fact, do you ever catch yourself wondering what he does all day?

The truth is, often we think, "What can my pastor do for me?" Far less often do we think, "What can I do for my pastor?"

Seasoned former pastor, Christopher Ash, urges church members to think about pastors not just in terms of what they do  how they lead and pray and preach and teach and so on  but about who they are. He encourages us to remember that pastors are people and to pray for them as they serve us. 

Paradoxically, caring for our pastor will be a blessing to us as well as to them, and create a culture of true fellowship in our church family.
