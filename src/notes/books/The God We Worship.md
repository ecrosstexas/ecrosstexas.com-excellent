description: We were all created to worship, but our worship runs amok, and we pour out our praise and affection before false gods. Meanwhile, we all too often go through the motions of worship as we join others in the pew on Sundays. Who can restore us and make us the worshipers we are supposed to be? Only God himself.

### About

This is not a book about you. 

It’s not about any person who’s going to pick it up.

No, these addresses fix on a much more glorious, worthy, and fascinating topic: the God, the Creator, the Redeemer as revealed in the Bible. The study of God is like a brilliant diamond—we should keep holding it up to the light to see new details of its beauty. 

Before the awe of such a God, what room is there to focus on man? Our only place is to respond to him—and even our response does not depend on us! We must not only worship him, but also—if our worship is to be meaningful and not cheapened—learn _how_ he is to be worshiped.

The Princeton Regional Conference on Reformed Theology presents the following pastor-scholars, who delve into the glory of God and into his grace in making sinners into worshipers: 

     God’s Glory Revealed — _Bryan Chapell_  
     Called by God to Worship — _Charles D. Drew_  
     Sought by Christ to Worship — _Richard D. Phillips_  
     Guided by God’s Sovereign Providence — _Joseph “Skip” Ryan_  
     Redeemed by God’s Sovereign Mercy — _Philip Graham Ryken_  
     Sanctifying Grace — _Michael S. Horton_  
     Our Holy Redeemer — _Richard D. Phillips_  
     The Spirit of Holiness — _Michael A. G. Haykin_  
     Know the Truth — _R. Albert Mohler_  
     I Am the Truth — _D. A. Carson_

Learn from these teachers about the glory of, the providential work of, and our proper response to the amazing God we worship
