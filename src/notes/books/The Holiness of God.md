description: Are you intrigued by God's holiness, or are you terrified? Encountering God's holy presence, R. C. Sproul argues, is a terrifying experience and the only way to cure our propensity to trust in ourselves and our own righteousness for salvation. In The Holiness of God, one of the classic theological works of our time, you will gain a better understanding of how having a biblical picture of God's holiness is foundational to God-honoring theology and Christian living.

Central to God’s character is the quality of holiness. Yet, even so, most people are hard-pressed to define what God’s holiness precisely is. Many preachers today avoid the topic altogether because people today don’t quite know what to do with words like “awe” or “fear.” R. C. Sproul, in this classic work, puts the holiness of God in its proper and central place in the Christian life. He paints an awe-inspiring vision of God that encourages Christian to become holy just as God is holy. Once you encounter the holiness of God, your life will never be the same.
