description: In this book, Alan D. Strange investigates the Westminster Assembly and the Westminster Standards to determine whether they affirmed the imputation of Christ’s active obedience as necessary for our justification. He also gives a survey of church history before and during the Reformation to see how the Assembly relates to the tradition before it. This study also reflects on the relation of imputation to federal theology, modern challenges to the doctrine, and important rules for interpreting the confessional document.
