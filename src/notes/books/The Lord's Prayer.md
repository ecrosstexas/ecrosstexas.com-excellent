description: In The Lord’s Prayer Watson analyzes in detail the Preface to the prayer and the six petitions which it contains. His treatment of the words ‘thy kingdom come’ is exceptionally full, illuminating and stirring. Like all great books on prayer it provides practical help because it concentrates on biblical instruction.

Thomas Watson was one of the most popular preachers in London during the Puritan era. His writings are marked with clarity, raciness and spiritual richness. Nowhere is this seen so clearly as in his outstandingly helpful exposition of the Shorter Catechism drawn up by the Westminster Assembly. The three-volume edition (of which this is the third) makes an ideal guide to Christian doctrine and practice and also serves as a wonderful introduction to Puritan literature.

In _The Lord’s Prayer_ Watson analyzes in detail the Preface to the prayer and the six petitions which it contains. His treatment of the words ‘thy kingdom come’ is exceptionally full, illuminating and stirring. Like all great books on prayer it provides practical help because it concentrates on biblical instruction.
