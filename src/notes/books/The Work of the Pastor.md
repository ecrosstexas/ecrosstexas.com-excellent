description: This world is full of distractions, and a pastor’s life is no different. With church politics, staffing issues, volunteer programmes and no end of other issues popping up, it can be difficult to keep focus. In this tremendous little book, William Still reminds us that the pastor’s main thing is feeding the sheep – i.e. the ministry of the Word. It has become a modern classic on preaching and pastoral ministry.
