description: In many modern histories of Christian missions, the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century is depicted as a movement lacking missionary zeal. it has virtually become a given that the Reformation was not oriented to the church's missionary task. in to win our neighbors for Christ, Wes Bredenhof answers these charges, proving that it is a mistake to say the Reformation and the confessional documents it produced have nothing to say about missions. the author demonstrates that the three forms of Unity the Belgic Confession , the Heidelberg Catechism , and the Canons of Dort properly understood, have much to offer the study of missions. more importantly, they encourage us to care about a world lost in unbelief, making us more mission oriented and outward looking.
