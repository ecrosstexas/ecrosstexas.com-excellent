## Description

Many understand salvation as an exclusively personal experience, often overlooking its foundation in real, historical events. In _Unfolding Redemption_, Camden M. Bucey and Lane G. Tipton shift the focus. They urge readers to grasp both the theological and personal implications of salvation’s accomplishment in redemptive history.

Drawing inspiration from seminal works such as John Murray’s _Redemption Accomplished and Applied_, this brief yet thorough treatment offers a fresh perspective. It explores the objective accomplishment of salvation by Jesus Christ in history and couples it with an exploration of how this accomplishment is subjectively applied by the Holy Spirit in the life of each believer.

The book serves as more than just a theological guide; it is a bridge between doctrine and experience. _Unfolding Redemption_ not only challenges readers to move beyond a simplistic, experience-driven understanding of salvation but also illuminates how the believer’s personal experience, shaped by the work of the Holy Spirit, fits into God’s grand narrative of redemption for his people throughout history.
