**Description**

Union with Christ is an important theological and practical concept that has received considerable attention in recent years. But not much consideration has been given to this union and its benefits in light of Jesus's resurrection and ascension.

In this follow-up to his monumental _A New Testament Biblical Theology_, G. K. Beale summarizes and expands on that work with an eye to fleshing out the theological implications of the resurrection and ascension. Beale explains that Christ's resurrection and ascension place him as the beginning of the eschatological fulfillment of the new creational kingdom. Specifically, Christ is the fulfillment of a cluster of nineteen Old Testament end-time expectations. These eschatological realities attributed to Christ are imprinted on believers through their dynamic union and identification with him. Through careful exegesis, Beale explores these facets and deliberately draws out important practical applications for everyday Christian living in the overlap of the old creation and the new.

Students of the New Testament will benefit from this important contribution to New Testament theology.
