**Description**

This booklet teaches readers why infant baptism is an essential practice for the Church. Ultimately, Reformed churches baptize infants because this practice heralds God’s glorious covenant promises. This visible proclamation of God’s word is a God-given means to cultivate biblical godliness in the Church, in parenting, and in the lives of our children. Ryan M. McGraw takes us beyond the question of whether infant baptism is right and shows us what difference it actually makes.
