description: "T. David Gordon has identified a problem, one that affects us all and needs fixing. Our preaching is just not communicating properly anymore. Fortunately, Gordon refuses to stand by and watchÂ—and we should too. In this short book, he provides a concise, in-depth look at the causes of this failure and also shows us how to make things better."
