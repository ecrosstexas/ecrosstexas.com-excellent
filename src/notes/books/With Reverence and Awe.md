### About

Even among Reformed Christians, _worship_ is a fighting word. Conflicting expectations for worship reveal that there is significant confusion about its nature, purpose, and practice.

Originally designed for Sunday school classes, this book is a primer to the fundamentals of worship, drawing from Scripture and Reformed confessions. By overviewing how Reformed theology informs how we think about, put together, and participate in a worship service, Hart and Muether prepare us to gather corporately for worship in ways that are appropriate to our Triune God.
