Type 0–Psalms: Written by God, perfect in every way, used as a guide to write new songs for glory and for beauty.

Type 1–Hymns and Spiritual Songs: Written by Christians specifically to be used in congregational worship.

Type 2–Written by Christians specifically to be enjoyed by the Christian community, contains themes unique to the Christian community, and in some way offends or excludes all other communities.

Type 3–Written by Christians specifically to be enjoyed by all communities, contains themes shared by all communities, seen through the lens of the Christian worldview.

Type 4–Written by Non-Christians specifically to be enjoyed by all communities, contains themes shared by all communities, seen through the lens of a secular worldview.

Type 5–Written by Non-Christians specifically to be enjoyed by non-Christian communities, revels in themes that the Christian worldview condemns, defines truth in ways that oppose Christian Truth, and in every way offends and excludes the Christian community.
