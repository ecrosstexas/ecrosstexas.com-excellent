 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,240
 The Bible tells us in the end times that Israel would be scattered and

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
 regathered, this has happened.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,000
 You want to talk about signs of the times, the super sign of the last days,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,920
 and really the sign that sets the prophetic clock ticking is the

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,840
 regathering of the nation Israel into their homeland.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,440
 >> This is a Bible cast special, Israel in crisis.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,640

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,720
 Ladies and gentlemen, the story you all about to hear is true.

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,240
 podcast devoted to recovering reform theology piety, and practice.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,240
 >> We're talking about practice, not a game, not a game, not a game.

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,080
 We're talking about practice.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,280

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,880
 We really need more cowbell.

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,040
 >> As I'm recording this, it's Wednesday, October 11th and it is 3.42.

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,560
 In the afternoon, year of our Lord 2023, the state of Israel has suffered what is being

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,240
 called the most serious attack in its history.

41
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,360
 300,000 reserves are being called up.

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,160
 She's facing the possibility of a two-front war, one front being in the south at the border

43
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,040
 with Gaza and the other in the north at the border of Lebanon and that would be with Hezbollah.

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,400
 According to dispensational premolenialists like Greg Lorry, whom you heard in the intro,

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,960
 this episode, what's happening now in Israel today is you're listing this, is a fulfillment

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
 of prophecy.

47
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
 Is he right?

48
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,440
 >> Oh, this is what we'll be considering in today's episode of The Heidelcast.

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,640
 And the short answer is yes and no, yes, but not in the way that the dispensational

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,520
 premolenialists think.

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:00,520
 In fact, in his Olivet Discourse, our Lord warned us that in the time between his ascension,

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,960
 his bodily ascension is going up in Devon and his bodily return, that time would be marked

53
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:12,240
 by, as he said, wars and rumors of wars, Matthew 24, 6, and we are certainly living

54
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,400
 through that.

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,560
 But we are not the first to live through that and that's important and something that it's

56
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,480
 easy for us to forget in the moment.

57
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,440
 So the answer to the question is also no, we're not living in a special time.

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,840
 We are living in the world as Jesus said it would be, as Paul said it would be, as the

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,040
 Apostle John said it would be until Jesus returns.

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,280
 We live in a fallen world that desperately needs to turn to Jesus for salvation.

61
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,080
 Now, Christian, I understand that social media and the old media are trying to keep you in

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,040
 a fevered state in order to keep you clicking and to keep you watching.

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,480
 But you need to know this, they are more concerned about clicks and eyeballs than they are about

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
 truth.

65
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,440
 The reality is, and I hope this encourages you, if you've been reading Scripture carefully,

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,640
 faithfully, and with the Church of all times and all places, then you have already seen

67
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,680
 this film and you know the ending.

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,120
 We've been living in the last days since Jesus ascended.

69
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,640
 I know that's what Greg Laurie said, but this is what God's words and I'm going to go through

70
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,160
 these passages with you in just a second.

71
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,200
 Christ is coming again once, noisily and visibly to consummate his kingdom, to deliver

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,200
 his people, all of them Jew and Gentile alike, everyone who's united to Jesus Christ by grace

73
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,560
 alone through faith alone in Christ alone and to judge his enemies.

74
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:51,120
 This is the Hidal Cast, the Hidal Cast at any time at 760-618-1563.

75
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
 So let's start with the caveat.

76
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,600
 If you're new to the Hidal Cast, I want you to know that we love Israel, we love Jewish

77
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,440
 Christians, we love the lost, and we love peace.

78
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,200
 We're praying also for Palestinian Christians who've been suffering under Islamist oppression

79
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:14,880
 and violence for a long time. It's not easy to be a Christian, a Palestinian Christian,

80
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,240
 especially not an evangelical Palestinian Christian.

81
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,000
 We understand that something very terrible has happened in Israel, that this is a terrible

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
 attack causing Israel to call up 300,000 reserves.

83
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:36,000
 And last I saw as many as a thousand Israelis have been brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists,

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,160
 Palestinian terrorists. So this is a very grave evil and ought to be and should be

85
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,160
 denounced by every civilized person everywhere.

86
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,800
 So I want to be clear about that.

87
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,720
 And I am particularly anxious for you to understand that because people say this,

88
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,360
 this is a reformed podcast about reform people are not anti-Semitic.

89
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,080
 And I'm going to try to make that clear as we go along.

90
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,560
 But we don't agree, at least I don't agree and most of us don't agree with

91
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,840
 dispensational premillennialism. And what often happens in these discussions is that people set

92
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,360
 it up so that unless you're a dispensationalist, and unless you agree with their reading of

93
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,120
 redemptive history and their understanding of prophecy in the future, that you are anti-Semitic.

94
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,640
 And that's simply not true. And in fact, I don't think it's too much to say that it's a violation

95
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:35,520
 of the ninth commandment. So I am a millennial, but not anti-Semitic and at the same time.

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,720
 And I will give you resources on this attached to the post. If you look at

97
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,760
 hydroblog.net when this is posted on Friday, you'll see an essay responding to the,

98
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:54,720
 I think scurrilous is not too strong a word, allegation that reformed theology, covenant theology,

99
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,840
 is replacement theology. It's not true. It is engrafting theology. We believe that God has always

100
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,960
 had a church. He had a church before Abraham was circumcised and he had a church since Abraham

101
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,720
 was circumcised. He promised to Abraham that he would make Abraham the father of many nations,

102
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,040
 and that since the ascension of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, he's been fulfilling

103
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:24,480
 that promise and that prophecy and engrafting Gentiles into the church. And in our understanding

104
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:31,120
 of Scripture, Ephesians 2, 14 is crucial. The dividing wall has been broken down.

105
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,840
 One of the things that I want to do in this episode is to read a lot of Scripture to you

106
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,720
 so that you can hear the context of these passages and understand them and be able to look at current

107
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,880
 events in light of what Scripture says in the way that Scripture intends to be interpreted. Now,

108
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,640
 let's listen to Ephesians 2 beginning with verse 11. This is from the English Standard Version.

109
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,920
 Therefore, remember that at one time you Gentiles, speaking to Gentile Christians,

110
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,600
 in the flesh called the uncircumcision by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the

111
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,000
 flesh by hands. Remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,440
 commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in

113
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,400
 the world. Now, listen to this, but now in Christ Jesus, you who are once far off

114
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,600
 have been brought near by the blood of Christ, for He Himself is our peace, who has made both one

115
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,000
 and has broken down, listen to this verse 14, in His flesh the dividing wall of hostility,

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances that He might create

117
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,400
 in Himself one new man in place of the two, making peace and might reconcile us both to God

118
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:59,760
 in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. Let me read verse 14 again.

119
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,000
 For He Himself is our peace, who made us, like Jewish Christians, Gentile Christians,

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,240
 both one, and has broken down in His flesh the dividing wall of hostility. There are a lot of

121
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:20,800
 theologies out there that basically live by rebuilding that dividing wall, and dispensationalism

122
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,800
 is chief among them. When I first became reformed, one of the most important things I learned

123
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,920
 was the truth of Ephesians 2 14. The dividing wall has been broken down, and therefore we

124
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,640
 understand that God is adding to His church. He's always had one church, there's always been,

125
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,720
 and only been, one covenant of grace in multiple administrations. There was an administration under

126
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,200
 Adam after the fall. There was a noe-weic administration, there was an Abrahamic administration,

127
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,320
 and then a Mosaic, and then a Davidic, etc. Now we're in the new covenant, it's the new

128
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,560
 administration of the one covenant of grace. And there's always been in Christ looking forward

129
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,160
 from the types and shadows, now looking back, if you will, from the new perspective of the new covenant,

130
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,880
 one people, one church where Jew and Gentile were divided before the incarnation with the

131
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,160
 obedience death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ is His resurrection, His ascension,

132
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,000
 His outpouring of the Holy Spirit. There is now one people dividing wall has been broken down,

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,240
 and Gentiles are being grafted in to the church. So that's not replacement theology. So we get

134
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,120
 the gravity of the situation, we understand that. We are praying for the safety of Israel as the most

135
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,880
 civilized state in the Middle East. An important ally to people who love freedom and

136
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,120
 a Republican democratic form of government everywhere, it's easily of all the places to live in the

137
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,840
 Middle East. Israel would be the place that you would want to live because you have a representative

138
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,560
 government, you have courts, you have some measure of civil liberties. Although to be fair, it is not

139
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,240
 always particularly easy to be a Christian in Israel, maybe for certain understandable reasons

140
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,000
 for history, but that is a fact. Just tried to build a church in Israel. It's very difficult.

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,160
 That being said, it is still a far better place, safer place for people who love liberty than

142
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,120
 virtually any place else in the Middle East. But there simply is no biblical reason to think

143
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,080
 that what Laurie says is true, that 1948, the formation of the modern state of Israel,

144
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,040
 is a fulfillment of prophecy. That's a bad way of reading scripture. It's not a biblical way of

145
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,080
 reading scripture. It is interpreting the Bible with the newspaper rather than interpreting the

146
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:54,480
 Bible with the Bible. I'm going to work on that in this episode. There are three or four things

147
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,040
 that I want to go through with you to try to help you think about this biblically and clearly,

148
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:07,520
 with the interest of setting your heart at ease. Not that you shouldn't be praying and concerned,

149
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:14,640
 you should be. We should all be praying and concerned. I certainly am. I have friends in Israel who

150
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:21,120
 are in a certain amount of danger. I have the children of friends who are literally on the front lines.

151
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,400
 As I'm speaking to you on Wednesday, who knows what has happened between the time I recorded this,

152
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,880
 and it was edited and all of that, and then made available to you on, we hope, midnight Friday

153
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,600
 morning. I don't know if, for example, the front will have expanded in the north, whether Hezbollah

154
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,360
 will have crossed in force, whether the Israeli army has gone on foot now and in tanks and APCs

155
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,880
 and the rest of that, invaded or responded by going on foot into Gaza. I don't know what will

156
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:04,080
 have happened by then, but whatever happens, it's going to be violent and ugly and very much a cause

157
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,920
 for prayer. Of course, our great prayer is that everybody in Israel, everybody in Palestine,

158
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,800
 everybody in the Middle East and everybody across the globe would turn in faith to Jesus Christ.

159
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,920
 No one is saved by virtue of their ethnicity. One is only saved by grace alone, through faith

160
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:30,880
 alone, in Jesus Christ alone. That is fundamental Christianity. Nothing that's happened or will

161
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,600
 happen or has happened or is happening right now in the Middle East changes that basic biblical

162
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,000
 truth, right? Ephesians two, again, is the word of God. Just before Paul says what he says

163
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,240
 about the dividing wall being broken down, right? He tells us exactly how people are saved for,

164
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,280
 by grace, this is Ephesians two, eight in the English standard version, you have been saved

165
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,400
 through faith. And this is not your own doing. It is the gift of God, not a result of works,

166
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,880
 so that no one may boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God

167
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:17,600
 prepared beforehand or in advance that we should walk in them. And there are other basic biblical

168
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:26,880
 truths that don't change simply because world events are turbulent. Listen to Paul in Colossians

169
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,800
 3, 11, here that is in Christ, those who are united to Christ by grace alone through faith alone.

170
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:41,440
 Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised. barbarian,

171
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:50,320
 Scythian, slave, free, but Christ is all and in all. And one more passage along those lines

172
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,080
 seems appropriate really just to nail this down. Again, this is the word of God. This is not

173
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,760
 speculation about what is happening in the newspaper and what it all means. This is Galatians 3,

174
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,760
 28. Again, the word of God, there is neither June or Greek, there is neither slave nor free,

175
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,640
 there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's,

176
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:21,840
 then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to the promise. It, as I said, in the episode that

177
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:28,640
 will come out on Sunday morning in the part of the series, the Roman series, as we're beginning on

178
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:37,920
 Romans chapter 11, it is by grace, not by race, that is not by ethnicity. That's again, a basic,

179
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,240
 biblical Christianity. All right, the next thing that you need to know is that we have been living,

180
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,880
 Greg Lorie says we're living in the last days. Well, we've been living in the last days, that's,

181
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,440
 I guess that's true, but it's not to do with 1948. It's to do with the ascension of Jesus Christ,

182
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,400
 the incarnation of God, the Son, his obedience, his death, his resurrection, and his ascension.

183
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:08,080
 How do I know that? Well, because Acts 2, 17 says, quoting Malachi, "And in the last days,

184
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,080
 it shall be God declares that I will pour out my spirit," that's the Holy Spirit, "on all flesh,

185
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,800
 and your sons and daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions,

186
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,080
 and your old men shall dream dreams." According to the Apostle Peter, as he's preaching the law in the

187
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:30,240
 gospel to the Jewish men gathered for the feast of Pentecost, they were witnessing the inauguration

188
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,360
 of the last days, and that was 2,000 years ago. So we have, I think a lot of American Christians have

189
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,400
 badly misunderstood what the Bible says about the last days. From a biblical point of view,

190
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:50,400
 from a New Testament point of view, we've been in the last days for 2,000 years because what

191
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:56,160
 marks the beginning of the last days is not the formation of a state in the Middle East in 1948.

192
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:03,040
 As important as that is for geopolitics, right? What changes redemptive history, what marks it,

193
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,840
 is the incarnation of God the Son. Here's the problem. A lot of Christians have an

194
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:16,160
 Israeliocentric theology and not a Christocentric theology, but the New Testament is not Israeliocentric.

195
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,440
 It's Christocentric. Listen to 2 Timothy 3.1, "But understand this, that in the last days,

196
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,800
 there will come times of difficulty." Now the Apostle Paul is warning Timothy about the nature

197
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,240
 of life after the ascension of Jesus Christ. We don't know exactly when he wrote first and

198
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,920
 second Timothy, but obviously it was before he died, and we know he died around AD 65 at the hand

199
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,360
 of the Romans on the Appian highway outside the city of Rome, not very far, but outside the city

200
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,680
 of Rome, he was martyred. His head was separated from his shoulders because he was a Roman citizen.

201
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:58,080
 So he was talking about the last days in AD 65. It's been the last days for a long time.

202
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,680
 Hebrews 1, 1 through 3. Listen again to the writer of the Hebrews, writing to Jewish Christians who

203
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,600
 attempted, sort of like dispensationalists, to go back to Moses, if you will. And this is what he

204
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,200
 says. "Long ago, at many times, and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,

205
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,160
 talking about the Jews. But in these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son, whom He appointed

206
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,880
 the heir of all things, through whom also He created the world. And He's going to go on to contrast.

207
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,920
 Jesus, as the owner of the house, and Moses, as the worker of the house. And to say to these Jewish

208
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,920
 Christians, "Don't go back to Moses. Don't go back to the types and shadows," because

209
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,920
 they all point to Jesus. It would be backward to go to the types and shadows when you have

210
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,120
 the reality. James 5'3. Now, he's in Jerusalem very early on, one of the earliest epistles in the

211
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,960
 New Testament. He's indicting a Jewish Christian congregation for saying that they have faith,

212
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:06,000
 but not manifesting that faith by obedience, by good works. And in chapter 5 verse 3, he says,

213
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,880
 "Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you,

214
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:18,640
 and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure." Listen to this in the last days.

215
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,280
 And what James is saying is, these are the days. This is the last epoch in the history of redemption.

216
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,320
 The next thing to happen, basically, is that Jesus will come again. Obviously, all the elect have to

217
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,360
 come to new life and true faith. We don't know when that will take place. And so, as far as we know,

218
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,280
 Jesus could come at any time. And so, we're looking forward to that. And there may be one or two

219
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,560
 things that have to come before Jesus comes, but that's the next really big thing. And then,

220
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:55,200
 finally, 2 Peter 3'3. Knowing this, first of all, that scoffers will come. Again, listen to this,

221
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,600
 in the last days with scoffing following their own sinful desire, 2 Peter 3'3. He's saying to

222
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,640
 the churches of Asia Minor, sometime, I think, in the 60s. We don't know exactly when Peter

223
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:17,520
 was martyred and by tradition, again, by the Romans. But we do know that it's in the period of

224
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,080
 the New Testament when he was writing this, and he's writing it about their time in the 60s,

225
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:31,520
 the 80s, 60s. Those are the last days. So, it's always been since the ascension of Jesus,

226
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,280
 the last days. I think that's just basic biblical data. I'm not pulling any rabbits out of any

227
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,280
 hats. I'm just rehealing Scripture and giving you the original context and then, you know,

228
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,080
 applying it a little bit. But I'm not doing anything fancy. All right. Next, Israel,

229
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:59,360
 not all Israel is Israel. The apostle deals with that in Romans, chapter 9. The context is very

230
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,320
 important, and it's the very question that we're thinking about, and that is, what about Israel?

231
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,600
 Lots of people are, as you heard in the opening audio, you know, have been, are obsessed now and

232
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,800
 have been for decades about the, or with the formation of the state of the Israel, the modern

233
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:21,840
 state of Israel, 1948. Lots of books have been sold, Lake Great Planet Earth, John Walvard's book.

234
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,600
 I don't remember the title. Lots of titles like that. And then the whole Left Behind series,

235
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,640
 all of that stuff, all basically premised on a couple of things. One, that there are two different

236
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:37,120
 kinds of peoples, an earthly people and a heavenly people, if you will, and also premised on the

237
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,000
 notion that God has a particular plan that he has yet to fulfill for a national people.

238
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,040
 And so that's why the question of who is Israel and what is Israel is so important.

239
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,040
 And the apostle Paul deals with that in Romans 9, 10, and 11. And the very short answer to that

240
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:02,800
 question is Israel is Paul's shorthand way of talking about the elect. In Christ,

241
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,200
 it is those who are elect, who are the Israel of God. And it doesn't matter whether you're

242
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,000
 Jew or Gentile. That distinction has been done away. And we saw that in Ephesians 2. And you see that

243
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,200
 in Romans. And if you go back and listen to the Romans series that I've been doing on chapter 10,

244
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,520
 till chapter 9, really, and then chapter 10. And then now we're in chapter 11, beginning this Sunday,

245
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,160
 you'll see that Paul again and again reiterates what he said in Ephesians 2.

246
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,360
 The dividing wall has been broken down. And there is no more dividing wall. So if you're theology,

247
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,000
 your eschatology, your understanding of the end times in the future requires there to be

248
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,320
 a distinction between Jew and Gentile. And you're looking forward to a reconstructed temple.

249
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,560
 You're looking forward to a re-institution of sacrifices. And if you think that people have a

250
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:01,520
 special status before God because of their ethnicity, you have not understood what Paul is saying in

251
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,600
 Romans 9, you've not understood Ephesians 2. And I understand I'm not judging you. I'm disagreeing

252
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,120
 with you, but I'm not judging you. I was there. And I remember when I became reformed and I

253
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,440
 said to the fellow who was first explaining the Reformed faith in me, I said, "What about Israel?"

254
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,280
 And he said, "The dividing wall has been broken down." I said, "But what about Israel?" He said,

255
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,360
 "The dividing wall has been broken down." I said, "What about Israel?" He said, "The dividing wall

256
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,960
 has been broken down." He wouldn't talk to me about eschatology until I reckoned with Ephesians 2.14.

257
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:37,200
 And I think that's true of you. At least it may well be. I know it's true of many, many American

258
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,160
 and modern evangelical Christians. They have not reckoned with Ephesians 2, and they're not really

259
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,240
 seriously reckoned with Romans 9, 10, and 11. What matters now according to the Apostle Paul

260
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,680
 is not whether you're Jew or Gentile, but whether you believe, and if you believe, it is because you

261
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:01,600
 are elect. And Paul says that repeatedly in 9, Romans 9, 10, and 11. It is by grace alone,

262
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:10,080
 through faith alone, in Christ alone. Not all Israel is Israel. Not everyone who is biologically

263
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:16,160
 Israel is Israel. That's what Paul says. And that's a basic truth. You've got to grasp that. It's not

264
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:23,120
 Paul says in Romans 9, 6, as though God's Word has failed. The reason that only some Jews have

265
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,720
 trusted in Jesus as Messiah, and this is the issue that he's dealing with here in Romans 9,

266
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:36,160
 10, and 11, why aren't more Jews putting their trust in Jesus? Because not all Israel is Israel.

267
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,560
 Nor Paul says, are they his descendants because they are all Abraham's children. Rather, Abraham's

268
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,400
 children, he says, are reckoned through Isaac. That's Romans 9, 7. And this means that it's not

269
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,960
 the natural children who are gods, but the children of the promise. That's Romans 9, 8.

270
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,960
 How was Isaac born? By the sovereign power of God. How are Christians born spiritually?

271
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,640
 By the sovereign power of God. Every Christian is an Isaac in his own way. Why is this so?

272
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,160
 Well, again, Paul says, before the twins were born, or had done anything good or bad,

273
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:20,080
 in order that God's purpose and election might stand, not by works, but by him who calls.

274
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,320
 She was told the older will serve the younger. This is a just reading scripture here. Just as

275
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:35,200
 it is written, Jacob, if I loved Esau, have I hated? This is the title cast at any time at 7,

276
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:45,440
 6, 0, 6, 1, 8, 15, 63. Paul is quoting Malachi 1, verse 2. And that's Romans 9, 11 through 13.

277
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,640
 How can it be? It is because God says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,

278
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,400
 and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion on Romans 9, 15. It does not, therefore,

279
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,120
 depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy. For the scripture says to Pharaoh. Now,

280
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,120
 listen to this. He's quoting here, Exodus 9, 16. I raised you up for this very purpose,

281
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,360
 that I might display my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.

282
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,840
 And now, Exodus 9, 16 is typically translated, that I might display my power to you. And Paul,

283
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,440
 I think, changes that a little bit. And says to Pharaoh, I've made you an instrument of my glory.

284
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,080
 He intensifies it, verse 18. Therefore, God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy,

285
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,640
 and he hardens whom he wants to harden. This is the biblical doctrine of reprobation. He comes

286
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,520
 back to this in chapter 11. God passes over some, he leaves them in their sins. He doesn't redeem

287
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,960
 everyone. It's down to election. And so I say, it's about grace, not about race. It's about grace.

288
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,320
 It's not about works. Is God unfair? Scripture says, well, according to the apostle Paul,

289
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:03,840
 as creatures, we have no rights before God. He's the potter. We are the clay. But Christians are

290
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,640
 redeemed clay, objects of mercy, prepared in advance for glory. And so you and I, we need to

291
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,840
 evaluate our condition against the backdrop of God's patience with those objects of wrath,

292
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,560
 prepared for destruction. I'm thinking about Romans 9, 22, and 23. These vessels prepared for

293
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:28,880
 glory are taken from Jews and Gentiles alike. That's Romans 9, 24. This is what he promised in

294
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:36,480
 Hosea, for he's made those who are once lo-a-me, not my people, that is Gentiles. To me, he says,

295
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:43,120
 sons of the living God, that's Hosea, at 223 and 110, and Romans 9, 25 and 26. The reason lawless

296
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,400
 Gentiles have, as he says, obtained righteousness, that's Baal's language, and that Israel, who

297
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,520
 pursued it by law, is not because justification is by works, but it's because it's by grace,

298
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,160
 Romans 9, 32. They stumbled over Jesus, the rock of offense. Jesus didn't fit their nationalist plans,

299
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:10,320
 and it doesn't fit the plans of the nationalist, Zionist, sort of pre-millennialist eschatology,

300
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,200
 especially dispensational pre-millennialism. That's what I'm really aiming at here. It's not

301
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,480
 that Paul doesn't want Jews to be saved, he very much does. Where it possible, he would give up

302
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,360
 his own salvation for the Jews to be saved, he says. The only way, he says, for a physical

303
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,120
 descendant of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to become a true Israelite, is to be joined to the true

304
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:39,600
 Israel of God, Jesus, for there is no difference between Jew and Gentile. The same Lord is Lord of

305
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,240
 all richly, blesses all who call on him. For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord

306
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,760
 will be saved. That's Romans 10. Has God rejected his people? No, you can't assume who his people are.

307
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,680
 You have to pay attention to what Paul says. The elect are his people, and all the elect

308
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:05,600
 Jew and Gentile alike will be saved. There are believing Jews. Paul uses himself in Romans 11.1

309
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,120
 as an example. He is a part of the elect remnant who have not bowed the knee to Baal.

310
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,080
 So Paul says, "So too, at the present time, just as there was a remnant under Elijah,

311
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:24,160
 there is a remnant chosen how? By grace." And now listen to this, 11.6, "And if by grace,

312
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,360
 then it is no longer by works. If it were, it would no longer be grace."

313
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,640
 So what Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. That's Paul's language.

314
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:44,560
 The others were hardened. Now listen again, who obtained it? The elect did. The others were

315
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:51,280
 hardened. That's God's word. That's not my opinion. I'm quoting God's word. God's election

316
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,960
 of some and his reprobation of others are twin facts of the history of redemption.

317
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,560
 And Paul brings those twin facts to bear on the question of who is the Israel of God?

318
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:07,840
 Time and time again he teaches. Salvation by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.

319
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:16,240
 And what Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but again Romans 11.7, the elect did.

320
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,240
 The others were hardened. Now is God finished saving Jews? Not at all. Salvation has come to

321
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:29,360
 the Gentiles. Paul says in Romans 11.11 for a specific purpose to make Israel envious. Gentiles,

322
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:36,160
 by God's undeserved favor, have been grafted on to the Israel of God. Israel has experienced a

323
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:42,720
 hardening, Paul says, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. And so all Israel

324
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,240
 will be saved. Romans 11.25 and 26. Maybe there'll be a future in gathering. I don't really see it,

325
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,640
 but I can see how people do see it. And that's a possibility. God certainly couldn't do it.

326
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,080
 And maybe that's what that means. But what we know with absolute certainty is that all the elect

327
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,040
 will be saved. And it is by grace and not by race. Again, you need to say that to yourself.

328
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,640
 It is by grace and not by race. Christians are, and this is a radical thing that you maybe have

329
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,960
 never heard. Christians are the Israel of God in Christ. And I want to think with you for a minute

330
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:22,000
 here about Galatians 616. It's such an important passage. And people, it seems to me they don't

331
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:31,040
 seem to be quite aware of it. Galatians 616, we'll start with verse 15. "For neither circumcision

332
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:36,880
 counts for anything." No, not by race, but by grace, nor on circumcision. So there's no virtue

333
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,240
 in circumcision any longer, no spiritual virtue, and no spiritual virtue in being uncircumcised.

334
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:49,360
 But listen to this, a new creation. Now listen to verse 16. "And as for all who walk by this rule,

335
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,360
 peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God." And so if you say, "Well,

336
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,160
 these are all of God," that means people who are physically, biologically, genetically Jewish.

337
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,960
 I don't know. That's not what he means. Anyway, he's already torn down, if you will,

338
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,240
 rhetorically, theologically, the dividing wall. You can't rebuild that and then use that to

339
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,040
 change the sense of Galatians 616. When he says, "And the Israel of God," this is another way of

340
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:23,040
 saying the same thing. In other words, everybody who is united to Christ by grace alone, through faith

341
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:30,240
 alone, is the Israel of God. How do I know that? Well, because I've read Romans 4. Again, listen to

342
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,880
 what Paul says in Romans 4, beginning at verse 1. "What then shall we say was gained by Abraham,

343
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,640
 our forefather according to the flesh?" Now listen, Romans 4. "For if Abraham was justified by works,

344
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,840
 he has something about which to boast, but not before God. For what does Scripture say? Abraham

345
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,160
 believed God, and it was imputed, credited, counted to him as righteousness." Different ways of

346
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,600
 translating that verb. "Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift, but his do,

347
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,120
 and to the one who does not work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted

348
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,560
 as righteousness." Justice David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts

349
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:16,640
 righteousness apart from works." Now go down to verse 9. "Is this blessing then only for the

350
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,680
 circumcised or also for the uncircumcised?" Now listen, "For we say that faith was credited to

351
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:30,960
 Abraham as righteousness. How then was it credited to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised?

352
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,240
 It was not after, but before he was circumcised. That means Abraham was a Gentile. He received the

353
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,760
 sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised.

354
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,920
 While he was still a Gentile. Remember, Abraham was a pagan. They were moon worshiping pagans

355
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:56,160
 in Ur of the Chaldis, basically southern Iraq. And God sovereignly called that pagan and made a

356
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,200
 nation out of him. And he said he was going to include into him all the nations. And that's exactly

357
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,800
 what Paul says here. "The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being

358
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,600
 circumcised." So Abraham is the first Gentile Christian. "So that righteousness would be counted

359
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,200
 to them as well." Romans 4-12. "And to make him the father of the circumcised, who are not merely

360
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:26,000
 circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was

361
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,480
 circumcised." Abraham is your father. If you are united to Christ by grace alone, through faith alone.

362
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:41,360
 It's not by race. That is not by ethnicity, not by biology, but by grace. Everybody who is in Christ

363
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:48,800
 is the Israel of God. Everyone who is in Christ is the Israel of God. Listen to 1 Peter 2 9-10.

364
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,040
 Where the Apostle Peter uses the same sort of language to describe the mostly Gentile

365
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,520
 congregations of Asia Minor to whom he wrote. Listen, once you were not a people,

366
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,560
 you can put that in Hebrew. Once you were low on me, not my people outside, but now you are the

367
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,920
 people of God. Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. So they have a new

368
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:21,440
 name, Ami, my people. The dividing wall has been broken down. Hebrews 8-10. According to the writer

369
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:28,800
 to the Hebrews, those who call on the name of Christ are the house of Israel. Everyone who is

370
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:36,400
 trusted in Christ is an heir of the promises of the new covenant. One last consideration before we

371
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,120
 finish with this episode. I want to think with you about Revelation chapter 20, because that's

372
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:49,360
 one of the basic premises on which people like Laurie talk about prophecy, end times, last things,

373
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,160
 and all of that. And I just have a very simple message here for just a minute or two about

374
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,160
 Revelation chapter 20. Maybe you've never heard this before. Maybe this is the first time that

375
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,880
 somebody's told you this. But the thousand years described in the Revelation are figurative.

376
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:12,400
 How do I know that? Because just about everything after 3-22 is figurative. In other words, we know

377
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,280
 where the churches were in Asia Minor, to whom the seven churches of the Revelation. Those are

378
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,760
 not figurative. We know where they are. We know where they were. And we know those towns,

379
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,800
 we know their circumstances. They've been fine works written on them. And they're not figurative.

380
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,080
 Now I'm not saying there's no figurative language, but those churches are not figurative. I think

381
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:40,400
 it's bizarre that people think that the churches are figurative, but Revelation chapter 20 is literal.

382
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:48,400
 No, that's exactly backwards. Look at Colin Hamer, his volume back in the 80s, H-E-M-E-R

383
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,640
 letters to the seven churches. I found that extremely helpful, but there have been a lot of

384
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,600
 good works on that. And look at the context of even chapter 20.

385
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:07,280
 Just going back to 1917. Then I saw an angel standing in the sun with a loud voice. He

386
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,880
 called to all the birds. Are these literal birds? This is what I'm going to do. I'm just going to

387
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,480
 ask you to think about. No, this is a figure of speech. Come gather for the great supper of God

388
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,000
 to do what? To eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of

389
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,480
 horses and the writers. Listen, that's figurative language. And most people recognize that's figurative

390
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,120
 language. And I saw the beast is that literal or figurative? Well, everybody, even the pre-millennialists

391
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,720
 think that's figurative. With their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on a horse.

392
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,200
 Who's sitting on a horse? Christ and his army. Is Christ literally sitting on a horse? No, it's a

393
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,120
 figure of speech. And the beast, again, figure of speech was captured. And with it, the false prophet

394
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,600
 who in his presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast.

395
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,280
 Everybody knows that pre-millennialists understand that that's a figure of speech,

396
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,800
 because they're always trying to figure out, well, what's the mark of the beast? Have I taken the

397
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:06,240
 mark of the beast accidentally? No, you haven't. Look at this, verse 21. And the rest was slain

398
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,880
 by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse. Well, that's Christ on

399
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,880
 the horse and the sword is his word. These are figures of speech. Now, chapter 20. Then I saw an

400
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,920
 angel. This is a vision. Remember, the Apostle John is given a vision. And it's essentially the

401
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,360
 same story told seven different times from seven different perspectives again and again. So it's

402
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,600
 impossible to say, well, where are we in the revelation? I remember asking that question sometime in the

403
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,680
 I don't know, I suppose mid to late seventies, maybe when I began to become reformed. I think I

404
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,760
 remember asking somebody, well, where are we in the revelation? The assumption is that the revelation

405
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,320
 is a linear roadmap and we can sort of map over history, you know, on top of the revelation and

406
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,120
 figure out where we are. That's exactly wrong. The revelation was written to churches in Asia

407
00:38:53,120 --> 00:39:01,040
 Minor about 80 93 to explain to them to answer the question, Hey, Jesus one Jesus was ascended.

408
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,240
 He's conquered. Why are we being put to death? Why are we being harassed? Why are we? Why are we in

409
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,520
 such difficulty all the time for being Christians? We thought he won. And John is writing to say,

410
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,240
 yes, you he did win. But his victory has yet to be consummated. And this is the nature of existence.

411
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:26,240
 Between the ascension of Christ and the return of Christ. So in chapter 20, John sees in his vision,

412
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,000
 an angel from heaven holding in his hand, the key to the bottomless pit again is this literal

413
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,440
 bottom is no, it's a figure of speech and a great chain, a literal chain or a figurative chain,

414
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,200
 well, figurative chain, of course, even on a pre millennial reading, it's a figurative chain.

415
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,240
 And he sees the dragon again, a literal dragon or figurative drag. I'm going to keep doing this

416
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,120
 because it you'll see why sees the dragon. That's a figure of speech. I think even on pre millennial

417
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:57,360
 readings, you're right. We're not now talking about literal dragons. Okay, and by the way, dragon is

418
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:04,400
 just a Greek word for for serpent. And John says that ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan

419
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,240
 and bound him for 1000 years. That's a figure of speech. There's not a literal chain on certain

420
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,360
 and Satan isn't literally a serpent. Took the form of a serpent, but he's not literally a

421
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,560
 serpent. He's an angel that went bad, that fell and threw him into the pit. Is it a literal pit?

422
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,200
 No, it's not a it's a figurative and shut it and sealed it over him so that he might not

423
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,600
 deceive the nations any longer until the 1000 years were ended. So figure it, figure it, figure it,

424
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,800
 figure it, figure it, and then 1000 years bang. That's literal. Really? If you're bound and determined

425
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,960
 to read the Bible that way, there isn't much I can do to help you. But you have to explain,

426
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,160
 if you expect to be taken seriously, you have to explain to me how it is that it's figured and

427
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,160
 figured and figured. If I've showed you all these figures, you agreed with me. Probably, I assume,

428
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,160
 I think that fairly, right? These are figures and then suddenly you're going to

429
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,400
 slam on the brakes and say, well, no, this is literal in the most figurative book in the Bible

430
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,280
 in a figurative chapter in a figurative book of the Bible that you're going to insist to me

431
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:08,080
 that when 1000 years pop up in verse three, that's literal. I don't find that compelling.

432
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,160
 And so you can say, well, you don't believe the Bible. Well, clearly you can tell that I do. We

433
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,840
 might disagree about what the Bible means to say, but you can clearly hear that I believe the Bible,

434
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,720
 every syllable is the inspired and fallible and errant word of God. And this is why I'm not a

435
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,640
 pre-millennialist and why Greg Laurie and all those like it. I'm not speaking on him. He's wrong,

436
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,920
 and so is Tim Lahay and all those cats, John Walvard and all the rest of them. They're all

437
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,320
 fundamentally wrong because they are reading scripture the way it means to be read. Verse four,

438
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,880
 then I saw thrones to get literal thrones or figurative thrones seated on them were those

439
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,560
 to whom the authority to judge was committed. I also saw the souls of those who'd been beheaded

440
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,400
 for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God and those who had not worshipped the beast

441
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:06,080
 or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life

442
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:12,800
 and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. Again, literal or figurative. He's talking about

443
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,120
 the period between the ascension of Christ and his return. It's a figure of speech. The rest of

444
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:25,040
 the dead. Did John literally see souls? Can you see souls disembodied souls? Literally? No,

445
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,640
 you cannot. It doesn't make any sense. We're supposed to read this as a vision. This is apocalyptic

446
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,680
 literature. We're supposed to read it the way it's meant to be read.

447
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:41,280
 Text to the title cast at any time at 7606181563. This is the title cast.

448
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,040
 Title cast. Blessed and holy is the one revelation 20 verse six is the one who shares in the first

449
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:54,880
 resurrection over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ,

450
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,760
 and they will reign with him for a thousand years. And when the thousand years are ended,

451
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,400
 Satan will be released from his prison. He's literally in a prison. Well, he's also going about

452
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,160
 like a lion seeking whom he made devour. You see, so you have to understand this in the way

453
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,520
 it's intended to be read and will come out to deceive the nation. This is one of the things that

454
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:25,840
 we, a millennialists expect to happen. Things will get ugly at the end before Jesus comes.

455
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:31,760
 Now remember in the middle of the 14th century, when a third of the world died of the plague,

456
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,000
 people said, well, this is the end of the world. Well, it clearly wasn't. So I had to be careful

457
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,840
 about interpreting prophecy and say, well, this is it. We're living in the middle of the 13th century.

458
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,880
 It was a long time ago. And here we are. And then he goes on to say, gog and maygog,

459
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,840
 together there for battle, their number is like that of the sand of the sea. And they marched up

460
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:59,040
 over the broad plane of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city.

461
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,520
 But fire came down from heaven and consumed them. And the devil who had deceived them was

462
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,560
 thrown into the lake of fire. And so forget literal lake or figurative lake of fire and

463
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,360
 sulfur. Well, it's figurative where the beast and the false prophet were again, the beast,

464
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:18,800
 figurative false prophet, a figure of something, someone, and they will be tormented day and night

465
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,360
 forever and ever. And I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it and from his presence,

466
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,360
 earth and sky fled away. I can't figure of speech. And no place was found for them. And I saw the

467
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,640
 dead, great and small, standing before the throne. And the books were opened. Does God literally have

468
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:43,200
 books? No, he does not. And this is a figure of speech. Then another book was opened, which is the

469
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,640
 book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books according to what they had

470
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:55,120
 done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them.

471
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,760
 And they were judged each one of them according to what they had done. Then death and Hades were

472
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,440
 thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was

473
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:12,480
 not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. And then chapter 21

474
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,880
 New Heavens and the New Earth. These are truths, absolute truths. But these are figures,

475
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:26,080
 you know, a figurative way of illustrating spiritual truths, spiritual realities. When I say

476
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:31,840
 spiritual, I don't mean not real. I mean really real, but real in the way that they're meant to be

477
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:39,280
 understood. Christ is coming. Christ has conquered. Christ has won. Behold, the dwelling place of

478
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:45,600
 God is with man. He will dwell with them. And they will be his people. And God himself will be with

479
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:53,840
 them as their God by the way that's borrowed from Genesis 17 and from Jeremiah as he adapts

480
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:00,160
 the Abrahamic promise. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more.

481
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:06,560
 Neither shall there be mourning or crying or pain anymore for the former things have passed away.

482
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,160
 And he who was seated on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new. Write this down.

483
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,640
 For these words are trustworthy and true. And he said to me, 'It is done. I am the Alpha and the

484
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,720
 Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life

485
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,400
 without payment, the one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God,

486
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:37,360
 and he will be my son.' But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers,

487
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:43,920
 the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the

488
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,320
 lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death. Christ has come. Christ has

489
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:57,200
 been raised. Christ has ascended. Christ rules. He's coming again. Fear not. The story you've just heard

490
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,440
 was true. Only the names were changed to protect the episode.

491
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,800
 That's it for this special episode of the Hidalcast. Join us next time for another

492
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,480
 thrilling episode as we return to our series in the Book of Romans, Sin, Salvation, and Service,

493
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,280

499
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:08,880
 Thank you, and good night for all of us at NBC News. Nothing is over until we decide it is.

500

501
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,240

 Just as we that heat.

505
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,840
 Trim and I were quickly on our way.
