[WLC Question #7, Part 4](https://largerforlife.podbean.com/e/wlc-question-7-part-4/)

In this episode of _Larger for Life,_ our hosts continue their study and discussion through the Catechism, this time examining Westminster Larger Catechism Question #7 (N.B.: this is the fourth of four episodes on this question, as WLC #7 lends itself to some lengthy and edifying discussion as we consider the various attributes and descriptors of God as they are highlighted in the Catechism):

Q. 7. _What is God?_  
A. God is a Spirit, in and of himself infinite in being, glory, blessedness, and perfection; all-sufficient, eternal, unchangeable, incomprehensible, everywhere present, almighty, knowing all things, most wise, most holy, most just, most merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.
