The ruling elder podcast talks with Chad Van Dixhoorn about the importance of the Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms to the work of the ruling elder.  
Says Chad, "It is a wonderful gift to be in a presbyterian church that does not try to work around the Standards but deploys them for all their various purposes."
