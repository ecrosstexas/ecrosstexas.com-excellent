2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Hello and welcome to "Polity Matters."

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 This is episode two of BYOBCO.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 My name is Ben Ratliff and I am joined by Scott Edberg and Jared Nelson.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,400
 Today we are continuing the discussion that we began last week on Preface of the PCA Book of Church Order.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,880
 That first section we discussed is called The King and Head of the Church.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,740
 And we discussed and went through that it establishes the regulative principle of polity.

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,200
 You know, that truth that we are Presbyterian because our king commands that we be so.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,000
 And it summed up well in the Title of Guy Waters book.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,400
 It's not how we run the church, but it's how Jesus runs the church.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,640
 And today we're going to embark on our journey through the next part of the Preface, part

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,800
 two, called the preliminary principles.

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,640
 But before we do that we have a guest.

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,400
 Jared why don't you introduce our ride along companion?

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,360
 Yes, so our other voice that you're going to be hearing today is that of Steve Tipton.

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,880
 He was somebody that I mentioned actually last time as one of the people that I used

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,360
 to watch it seemed to know what he was actually doing polity wise.

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,520
 And he is used to be in our Presbyterian and Ascension was moderator there.

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,440
 He's been in RPR which is review of Presbyterian records, has been even chairing that.

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,400
 And as even at one time been upfront at General Assembly as an assistant parliamentarian.

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,640
 So I thought that he could help us along with a little bit of this, but also thought maybe

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,840
 Steve you could just give us a brief introduction to you and when did you get interested in

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
 Presbyterian polity?

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,480
 Yeah, well, thanks guys for having me on.

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,920
 That was a very generous introduction by Jared.

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,080
 I wasn't really sure I recognize myself there and some of that.

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,800
 I was raised Southern Baptist.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,160
 I was not a Christian at the time.

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,240
 I mean, I was in a believer at the time, but you know, belong to a sort of Baptist church.

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,080
 And so I got to see kind of congregational polity and all of it, you know, expediency

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,200
 and able to do certain things quickly, but also from time to time saw some of the negative

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,760
 sides of that polity.

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,640
 I mean, really didn't understand it at the time, but kind of looking back, seeing some

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,360
 of the things that can happen in congregationalism.

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,040
 When I met my wife, he grew up, Presbyterian, she grew up in the PTUSA.

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,600
 And so when we got married and we're going to church with her, I was going to church,

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,720
 I could see a very different side of again, church polity, not knowing those terms or

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,520
 ways of understanding things.

39
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,120
 Came to an appreciation certainly for reform theology through that, but not so much on the

40
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,440
 polity side, just, you know, it's kind of more of an advanced level than just the theology

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
 piece.

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,840
 But I felt called to ministry and we eventually moved from the PTUSA to the PCA while I was

43
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,240
 still doing my undergraduate work in California and then eventually went to RTS and Jackson.

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,760
 And I think it was just, you know, sometimes it's the friends that you make.

45
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,800
 And so I got to know Guy Waters pretty well.

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,800
 We both, I think it was the same year, we started the same year there.

47
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,280
 Obviously he was teeping and I was a student, but just got to know him a little bit and

48
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,240
 really appreciated his insight into polity issues, to polity from, from Guy.

49
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,800
 He's been a friend of mine ever since.

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:42,120
 Really I think it started in maybe the second year I was in tension, Jared, maybe at the

51
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,360
 same time we got there.

52
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,280
 There was a, we had a representative to go to RPR, review of Presbyterian Records who

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
 couldn't go because of scheduling issues.

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,200
 And that individual was my, one of my ruling elders.

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,640
 And so he encouraged me to take his spot.

56
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,520
 It really was sort of baptism by fire, trying to figure out, you know, what was going on

57
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,120
 and what all these people were talking about.

58
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,440
 And I think maybe that was really what got me interested in the polity of the church and

59
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,760
 digging through and seeing kind of how the sausage is made.

60
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,600
 I guess it's going to do one of two things.

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,080
 You're going to hate sausage forever.

62
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,320
 Or that's all you want is more sausage.

63
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,560
 So I'm one of the more sausage guys.

64
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,120
 I just, I really, really enjoyed it and have been back a number of times and just wanted

65
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,120
 to learn more about our BCO and how, how it worked.

66
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,080
 I've read quite a bit, not as extensively as some.

67
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,280
 But probably more than most perhaps in our, you know, polity, ecclesiology type things

68
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,400
 and just continued to enjoy that aspect of what it means to be a Presbyterian.

69
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,720
 I know the listeners can't really get a sense for this without seeing us, but the, the aura

70
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,040
 at play with three RTS Jackson grads on the same screen is, is unbelievable.

71
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,800
 Well, if you're following along, if you've pulled up the BCO and you're able to look

72
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,040
 at the preface with us, you'll see that in preface to just before the preliminary principles

73
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,520
 begin to get listed, there's sort of what we're calling a preamble.

74
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,800
 Since that's where it starts, we're going to start there too and just work our way through

75
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,960
 this document and we've, we have some thoughts for you as we discuss.

76
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,960
 So the beginning, the preamble goes like this.

77
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,680
 The Presbyterian Church in America in setting forth the form of government founded upon

78
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,440
 an agreeable to the word of God reiterates the following great principles which have

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,800
 governed the formation of the plan.

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,200
 And I was wondering, Jared, if you could start us off here, maybe explain a little bit about

81
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,800
 the source of these principles that are about to follow.

82
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,600
 Yeah, these preliminary principles are not universal in every single Presbyterian church

83
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,520
 that you'll find even in America, but they did begin in America.

84
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,520
 They were fixed to the form of government in 1788.

85
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,120
 And eventually they get lost in the Southern Presbyterian Church for some reason.

86
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,840
 They no longer become part of their constitution and then the PCA discovered the McGinnicus

87
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,040
 and the Attic and then re-affixed them to the beginning.

88
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,800
 These were written when this was going to be a Presbyterian church in America.

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,600
 It's not in the colonies anymore.

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,760
 They were coming into their own.

91
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:19,640
 They were revising even the Constitution in chapter 20 and 23, especially of the Westminster

92
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,920
 standards.

93
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,440
 And it's at least kind of, I don't know if it's about legend or just one person at least

94
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,040
 had said this guy, Ashbell Green, that John Witherspoon was the guy that actually came

95
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
 up with him.

96
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,800
 He was on the committee and may have actually coined them all.

97
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,400
 And wrote these as kind of the background, the foundations of the entirety of what follows

98
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
 later.

99
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,560
 So I don't know if you would really call them like the Bill of Rights to the BCO because

100
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,800
 they don't quite function that way.

101
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,640
 You can't really like get things overturned.

102
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,680
 I don't think in the rest of the BCO if you appeal to them.

103
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,320
 It doesn't quite work that way.

104
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,160
 Everything really should be seen in light of these and it gives us a basis for if we're

105
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,680
 going to add or subtract to it.

106
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,400
 Do they fit with the preliminary principles or do they undermine them, which can also

107
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,960
 lead to some interesting questions later if we have parts of our BCO that may seem not

108
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,240
 to go with that.

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,920
 Do they actually align or do they not?

110
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,720
 Maybe we can talk a little bit more about that later.

111
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,800
 Scott, why are the principles needed?

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,760
 Well, I was thinking through that question and I started going down the rabbit hole with

113
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,720
 other constitutions.

114
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,360
 And so I don't know if you know this, but you can buy the RPCNA book a church order for

115
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,600
 free on their website.

116
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,920
 I don't know why they make you buy it, but you have to go through all of that.

117
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:49,480
 And so I was looking through other constitutions wondering just the how wide the application

118
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,160
 for using preliminary principles were within the reformed world.

119
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,040
 And I found not many denominations use them, at least how we use them.

120
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,600
 There's no preliminary, some of the content is used elsewhere, like in the RPC, the RPCNA

121
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
 and the RPCNA.

122
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,800
 But there's not many denominations even today that have a guiding principle set that

123
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 we do.

124
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,680
 The importance for that is that they remind us as we are amending the constitution and

125
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,640
 following the Constitution, the foundation of the Constitution.

126
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,880
 And so you'll hear throughout the assembly and throughout the various committees as they

127
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,080
 do their work appeals to the preliminary principles, the CCB will often say, we cannot

128
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,000
 pass this, the CCB is sometimes ignored.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,520
 We cannot pass this because it relates PP1, preliminary print one.

130
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:46,080
 And so it's a good framework for thinking about what holds together or what we seek to

131
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,520
 hold together our Constitution.

132
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,840
 But I maybe have a question why to the broader group, maybe even just Steve, how do denominations

133
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,760
 function without preliminary principles as it relates to their Constitution?

134
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,800
 Yeah, I don't know how necessarily they function without it.

135
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,360
 I mean, imagine in the same way we would if we just took them out.

136
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,760
 I mean, you still have a BCO that has all the questions for all the things that you do.

137
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,760
 Not having it wouldn't necessarily be in that sentiment.

138
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,200
 I mean, clearly their polity is based upon the principle that are in the preliminary

139
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,040
 principles, whether they believe it is or not, to some degree or other.

140
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,960
 But I do think that part of this is Presbyterian history.

141
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,720
 And there are many people who much better to get on and to talk about history, Presbyterian

142
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,480
 United States, but there are many different kind of streams and review lists that come

143
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,760
 out of whether it's Scotland, Ireland, different times in Scotland.

144
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,480
 I would say that these preliminary principles having been, assuming that they were, by

145
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,080
 Witherspoon so early on, that they're going to be more attached to kind of American Presbyterian

146
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
ism.

147
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,800
 So for instance, like the ARP, it shouldn't be surprising.

148
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,720
 The ARP wouldn't have them because they are an associate, the Associate Presbyterian Church

149
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,600
 and the Reform Presbyterian Church that came over later on.

150
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,480
 And so they're going to adopt a more Scottish form, whereas in some ways those preliminary

151
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,080
 principles were an attempt to, maybe do two things, right?

152
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:23,880
 To reach back into established Presbyterian principles, but also to have a, this could

153
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,720
 be misunderstood or showed like a uniquely American form.

154
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,160
 I mean, again, it's not entirely unique.

155
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,280
 It's entirely separate, but things like, you know, the division between the state power

156
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,520
 and the church power and how those things work and our principles are a little different

157
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,600
 than what our Scottish forefathers believed and argued for.

158
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,720
 And so I think in that sense, they were an opportunity to kind of draw a line in the

159
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
 stand.

160
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,800
 And again, that analogy can also be missed, but to draw a line somewhere and say, okay,

161
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,560
 these are the principles upon which American Presbyterian, this particular way of doing

162
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,400
 materialism is going to be established and followed.

163
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:10,880
 And if my memory serves some looking on the PCA historical site, I think they were really

164
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,160
 adopted by the OPC, but then somehow they dropped out of their VCO.

165
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,120
 And that may just be an editorial issue more than anything else.

166
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:27,400
 Even the PCU apps, they dropped out fairly early on, you know, long before liberalism

167
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,520
 had become a problem in the PCU apps.

168
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,720
 It wasn't a liberal move to reject or whether you want to call it reject or just remove

169
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,840
 the preliminary principles.

170
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:46,840
 I think we can say it's a mark of proper Presbyterianism to have them rather as a continuing church.

171
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:53,760
 We have seen the wisdom and the having those principles in our book of church order and

172
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,280
 seeking, maybe not always succeeding, but keen to build form our government on that

173
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
 foundation.

174
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,040
 Can you think of a time perhaps in the PCA's history where a BCO amendment has been added

175
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,800
 to our constitution that violated one of these principles?

176
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:16,640
 No, no, no, I, but I do think that the principles are broad enough.

177
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,000
 And our foundational in nature so that in one sense, I think it would be very difficult

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,840
 for us to pass an overture that would directly contradict a preliminary principle.

179
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,400
 It would be really hard to do that.

180
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,600
 Now there have been times where phrases could be but to be in conflict with a preliminary

181
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,160
 principle.

182
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,720
 Usually I don't have them enumerated in front of me and I don't have them memorized either.

183
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,080
 But you know, the one that talks about the congregation electing officers and there have

184
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:53,000
 been some things that have been tried in the past that I don't think were done maliciously

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,200
 to remove that principle, but just not well thought out so that the, an action that could

186
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,840
 be taken by a presbytery would in fact violate that principle.

187
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,560
 And so in my memory, those things going through overtures, they get either amended very easily

188
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,160
 or they just get defeated because or sent back to the presbytery or whatever, especially

189
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:21,760
 overtures that committee, there is a sincere desire to not violate this preliminary principle.

190
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,520
 Well, one other thing we probably should ask is why are we doing the preliminary principles?

191
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,160
 How is it significant?

192
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,240
 And I wonder if Steve would still have this.

193
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,040
 I remember telling you the story of having the question during one of my, I think it was

194
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,520
 during my licensure exam.

195
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,000
 They asked me what is the most important part of the BCO?

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
 And I said, well, I don't know.

197
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,640
 And the guy answered the index.

198
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,320
 And I remember telling you that story and then you remember what your reply was, right?

199
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,320
 Probably something like that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

200
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,360
 Yeah, I mean, okay, indexes are really important.

201
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,840
 Actually, I never use my index because I have my BCO on my iPad and I just search for things,

202
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,720
 but maybe the search function now becomes the most important part.

203
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,240
 If we're going to say that our quality is built upon called principles, and if it isn't built

204
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,200
 upon biblical principles, then what's the point of following it?

205
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,840
 Just to say it's better or wiser or more convenient in some other way.

206
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,680
 If we believe that our quality is built upon biblical principles, then it would be helpful

207
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,320
 to have a place where we talk about what those principles are.

208
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:38,040
 And certainly, we are not exhausting those biblical principles in the preliminary principles,

209
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,480
 but it's important to recognize what principles are.

210
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,520
 In one sense, the preliminary principles, I would say, sort of act like prolagomena in

211
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,080
 a theological system.

212
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,720
 You know, prolagomena is usually not most people's favorite part of theology, but it's incredibly

213
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,800
 important because it sets out the definitions of the terms that we're going to be talking

214
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
 about.

215
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,000
 It sets out the direction, the limit of those terms.

216
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,120
 It provides the groan, particularly prolagomena, is where you talk about scripture as that

217
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,320
 principle of the theology itself.

218
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,040
 And what is the scope of your theology or in our case?

219
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,160
 What is the scope of your quality?

220
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,680
 So I would argue that the preliminary principles are the most important part of the BCO, that

221
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,640
 if you don't understand them, if you're not conversant in the ideas that they talk about,

222
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,120
 again, you don't have to memorize them, but if you're not conversant in those concepts,

223
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:39,240
 then ultimately, your polity becomes a function of just human wisdom.

224
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,200
 We understand from our Vice-Mr. Confession of Faith that there are circumstances of church

225
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,400
 government that are common to human society.

226
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,920
 And they're guided by the light of nature, they're guided by Christian prudence, and they're

227
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,920
 always to be in conformity with the Word of God.

228
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,280
 But without preliminary principles, I think more and more of our polity, more and more

229
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,400
 common notions per se, are going to encroach upon our polity.

230
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,120
 And we're not drawing it back consistently to our understanding of what scripture says

231
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,760
 and what scripture does.

232
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,240
 And these principles do that.

233
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,680
 They don't just tie us back to scripture, but they tie us back to the confessions and

234
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,440
 interpretations of scripture.

235
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,680
 I mean, preliminary principle one, which I imagine we'll be looking at in just a second,

236
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,440
 it's very much kind of an amalgam, just the different places in the Confession, drawing

237
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,200
 them together and placing them in a room that reminding us of their importance for polity.

238
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,680
 I would certainly encourage people to study them, to think about them, and to understand

239
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:49,360
 their importance, their place, and to seek to, in some sense, interpret the BCO in light

240
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
 of them.

241
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:57,040
 So we have to be careful, BCO 17, 2, whatever that is, means what it says, right?

242
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,080
 It doesn't mean what it says as interpreted through the lens of some other document or

243
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,560
 some other place in the BCO.

244
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,600
 It means what it means as it's written there.

245
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,200
 But it is built upon a foundation that comes from the pulmonary principles.

246
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:17,920
 And so I don't think they stand like a Bill of Rights or something that can, you know,

247
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,960
 change, alter what comes after it.

248
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,640
 And so we're going to find in our study of the BCO that there's a provision that violates,

249
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,680
 clearly violates a preliminary principle.

250
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,800
 There's no way to interpret that in light of a preliminary principle because it's an

251
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
 impression of it.

252
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
 It needs to be changed.

253
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,120
 It needs to be updated, altered, or removed, or whatever.

254
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,640
 I think that there's a sense in which we can move beyond the way these two pieces are

255
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
 actually put together.

256
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,680
 So we're going to put the preliminary principles on one hand within the actual provisions on

257
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
 the other.

258
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,280
 Well, we're all eager to move along to the first of these principles.

259
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,240
 And since all of you are probably scrambling to find your BCO, 17, 2 is actually the definition

260
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,800
 of the doctrine of ordination.

261
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,560
 So you can save yourself some time.

262
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,880
 Here's preliminary principle number one.

263
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,080
 God alone is Lord of the conscience and has left it free from any doctrines or commandments

264
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:21,120
 of men, A, which are in any respect contrary to the word of God, or B, which in regard

265
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,320
 to matters of faith and worship are not governed by the word of God.

266
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,160
 Therefore, the rights of private judgment and all matters that respect religion are

267
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,880
 universal and inalienable.

268
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,160
 No religious constitution should be supported by the civil power further than may be necessary

269
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,280
 for protection and security equal and common to all others.

270
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,960
 Steve, we've heard a lot from you, but I do want you to begin this one for us.

271
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,720
 What does it mean there that God alone is Lord of the conscience?

272
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
 Yeah.

273
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,880
 So, I mean, again, it's establishing a principle that is, or I guess it's not establishing

274
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,720
 a principle, it's borrowing a principle from our Westerns, your confession of faith, 21,

275
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,680
 if I remember correctly, that makes reference to the idea that God alone is Lord of conscience

276
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,920
 and has left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men and uses very similar

277
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,240
 language as it follows.

278
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,720
 And the idea that the confession is speaking to discuss and to give words to and that our

279
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,520
 colonial principles have attached on to, the idea is that no one other than God, no one

280
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,800
 other than Christ ultimately is Lord of our conscience.

281
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:39,080
 And so a church or the state for that matter cannot create doctrines, they cannot create

282
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,000
 commandments for us to follow.

283
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,560
 If they are, if they are in any respect, contrary to the Word of God, then they are beyond what

284
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
 God has said.

285
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,080
 So, we cannot, as a church, we cannot require people to believe things other than what God

286
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,080
 has directed us and given us some doing his word.

287
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
 We can't tell people to do things.

288
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,120
 We can't require a duty of them, not also found in God's Word.

289
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,400
 And certainly you think about faith and worship, right?

290
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,720
 Again, we cannot require someone to believe things that we don't have recourse to the

291
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:21,400
 Bible and our ship is regulated, is governed by the Word of God, not by the doctrine and

292
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
 commandments.

293
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,040
 And so we talk about the idea of the right of private judgment is another important piece

294
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
 of this.

295
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:36,920
 And it is not denying the fact that God is Lord of the conscience, that there is no

296
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:44,800
 other Lord of how I am to understand whether it's faith or practice and practice in a variety

297
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,200
 of ways, whether it's worship in particular, or it's polity or any other thing.

298
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,640
 There's no other guide to faith and practice than is the Word of God.

299
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,120
 And that Word is the Lord's Word and He is the one who rules and reigns and the hearts

300
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,880
 and the consciences of men.

301
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,960
 And so no one else can take that role of being the Lord of someone's conscience.

302
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,560
 And any thoughts on that middle portion, especially when we get to the A and B about respecting

303
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,140
 God's Word, the issue of matters of faith and worship, maybe you guys want to distinguish

304
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,600
 between those and walk us through.

305
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,600
 Well, I've done, I've just stopped myself from becoming a covenanter this week as I

306
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,040
 read Bannerman on this issue because he would have A, B and C on this.

307
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,720
 He would have that there are limits to the Christian conscience, liberty of conscience

308
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,560
 as relates to the Word of God as we've referenced here in faith and worship.

309
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,640
 But then he would also include the ordinance of civil authority.

310
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:53,760
 And so that the magistrate himself has some responsibility in the life of not only the

311
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:02,880
 church, but society itself with regards to what the church believes, but also practices.

312
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:11,000
 I think most poignantly it deals with, and at least in Bannerman, the idea of how the

313
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,520
 state itself legislates certain and criminalizes certain activities, whether they be heresy

314
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,440
 or blasphemy.

315
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,280
 That's not really applicable to the American context.

316
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,160
 And so I think that's part of the preliminary principle one for us is at the end there, it

317
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,600
 sidesteps the civil authority as how Bannerman would outline.

318
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:41,200
 But the first two points A and B are very historical to Presbyterianism.

319
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:48,120
 Bannerman says on the first A, the first limit then sets the right of conscience as the obligation

320
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,400
 to the law of God, the divine law.

321
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,080
 There cannot be a more dangerous tenant than that which under the plea of liberty of conscience,

322
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,440
 expressly or virtually denies this limitation.

323
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:05,360
 And what that's getting at is that we do not have the liberty to do what is morally wrong.

324
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,840
 We hear perhaps in our own culture and day and age where it's everyone appeals to liberty

325
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
 for everything.

326
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,160
 I've Christian liberty to do this, that or the other thing, but there is a limit and

327
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,080
 that limit is God's law.

328
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,760
 God, as Steve said, is the Lord of the conscience.

329
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,080
 We have no liberty to disobey him and the law that he's given to us.

330
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:31,640
 And then B, maybe there's a limit to this, a limit to the limit, but also then the ecclesiastical

331
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,960
 authority that is over you and you as we'll get to one of the other preliminary principles

332
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,200
 of the membership within the church.

333
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
 What does that look like?

334
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,800
 What do we submit to?

335
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,560
 Where are the limits perhaps of our relationship with our own congregations?

336
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,080
 A good example could perhaps be what do we allow within our congregation to be believed

337
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,640
 or even talked about?

338
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,840
 Maybe things like Paedo Communion or baptismal regeneration or federal vision.

339
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,040
 Do you have the liberty of conscience to believe those things within the context of this congregation

340
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
 and teach that?

341
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,680
 Well, maybe there's a limit there.

342
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,400
 And so there's a limiting factor.

343
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,840
 We don't have unlimited freedom and liberty to believe whatever we want as it relates to

344
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,640
 the church and God.

345
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:22,960
 There are great limits on the church particularly, but we have no liberty to disobey the Lord,

346
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
 the Lord himself.

347
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,360
 Yeah, I think one thing that Bannerman talked about, which is also very helpful along that

348
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:34,560
 same line, is an idea that, and obviously he's echoing language of the confession anyway,

349
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:41,040
 but it's this idea that the Lord who is Lord of conscience is the same Lord who has established

350
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:47,080
 the civil magistrate and the church as an ecclesiastical power.

351
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,000
 And so he has ordained both the civil authority and the ecclesiastical authority.

352
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,440
 And even our confession talks about this idea of disobeying these lawful authorities in matters

353
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:09,360
 that are not faith and worship is under the guise of liberty is to sin against that liberty,

354
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,720
 to sin against that conscience.

355
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,560
 And so I think those are important points, especially in an American context where very

356
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,640
 much the spirit of individualism and I get to know what I want and nobody can tell me

357
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
 what I can't do.

358
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,880
 And the civil magistrate, even as much as we might disagree with it, is still ordained

359
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,560
 by the Lord and the lawful injunctions of civil magistrates, we can't in good conscience

360
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,000
 deny the right of the civil magistrate to enact laws.

361
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,400
 And as long as they're not requiring us to sin, we can't disobey, right, just because

362
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,640
 I don't like them or because we don't like people telling us what to do.

363
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,920
 And so in a similar way, obviously there are differences between civil power and ecclesiastical

364
00:25:52,920 --> 00:26:00,160
 power where the church has authority to do the things that it does, obviously ministerial

365
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:10,440
 and declarative, a person cannot plead liberty of conscience to ignore or to deny the lawful

366
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,560
 ordinances of ecclesiastical authority.

367
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,920
 One thing I like about Bannerman in this section is that he asked the question of where is

368
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
 the limit?

369
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:24,680
 Where's the line on the civil magistrate and our freedom of liberty?

370
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,040
 And he basically says, I cannot draw that line.

371
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,160
 I don't know.

372
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,680
 I don't know where it is.

373
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,920
 And he posed the question to the reader.

374
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,160
 Maybe you can figure out where that line is.

375
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:41,600
 But one thing I did like from the civil realm is when he was noting it, he says civil authority

376
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,360
 is not absolute or unlimited for there is a point wherein it's exercise, it meets its

377
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,200
 rightful domain of conscience and the short the sword ought to be sheathed and to give

378
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,680
 way before claims which the conscience pleads.

379
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,760
 It's on the other hand is not absolute or unlimited either for there is a point where

380
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,440
 the rights are met and bounded by the rights of the civil authority.

381
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,960
 And that's how he concludes that section.

382
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,280
 And I guess that in some ways sums up what we're talking about.

383
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,160
 Well, it could be helpful to just a little since we've been walking through this, that

384
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:23,000
 last sentence I think is important to see this as a fairly American approach to the relationship

385
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,560
 between the church and the state because Bannerman will talk about the spirituality of the church,

386
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,280
 but it looks a little bit different in an American context because a lot of this is

387
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,000
 a restatement of Westminster Confession 20, which is on the conscience.

388
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,560
 But that chapter is actually different in the American version when it talks about imposing

389
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:46,160
 of the civil or of censures by the church, the original version had at the very end that

390
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,920
 it's enforced by the censures of the church and by the power of the civil magistrate.

391
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,200
 And that's taken out in the American version.

392
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,080
 In fact, the early adoption act allowed people to take exception to that and to parts of

393
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,440
 23 that were in the civil magistrate that they disagreed with.

394
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,480
 They eventually rewrote them.

395
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,240
 But this statement at the end, no religious constitution should be supported by the civil

396
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,120
 power further than maybe necessary for protection and security equal and common to all others.

397
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,840
 Maybe it'd be something that a Combinator would not be comfortable with affirming and

398
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:27,360
 gives our polity a bit of a different flair an American hints to it.

399
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,880
 Yeah, I mean, there's this kind of interesting, even connotations in the way that sentence

400
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:39,480
 is written because it seems to suggest not that there is a protection of security and

401
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:46,760
 equal and common to all Christian churches, but religious constitutions or you might

402
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,720
 say, you know, the religious bodies that create constitutions or something like that.

403
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,160
 And so it's not even necessarily trying to suggest that this should be extended only

404
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,480
 to churches, only to totally not just reform churches or anything like that, but it seems

405
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,400
 to be that there ought to be a protection and security equal and common to all other

406
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:12,920
 religion supported by civil power, which it doesn't quite say that, but it seems to

407
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,760
 be leaning pretty hard in that general direction.

408
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,920
 Very good.

409
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,240
 Here's preliminary principle number two.

410
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,600
 In perfect consistency with the above principle, every Christian church or union or association

411
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,120
 of particular churches is entitled to declare the terms of admission into its communion

412
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,880
 and the qualifications of its ministers and members, as well as the whole system of its

413
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,760
 internal government, which Christ has appointed.

414
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,920
 In the exercise of this right, it may notwithstanding air and making the terms of communion, either

415
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,960
 to lacks or to narrow yet even in this case, it does not infringe upon the liberty or rights

416
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,680
 of others, but only makes an improper use of its own.

417
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,440
 Steve, I'm going to I'm going to pass to you again to get us going as we begin talking

418
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,600
 about this principle.

419
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,800
 It stands out to you here.

420
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,040
 What do you see as the starting place?

421
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
 Yeah.

422
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:15,320
 So, I mean, this is talking about the importance of unions, associations of particular churches,

423
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:24,920
 churches with a big C in that sense, to declare who can be a member, and particularly, I

424
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:34,440
 think even more than that, who can be its ministers, who can teach, exercise, the office

425
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:41,200
 of pastor, teacher, elder, deacon, et cetera.

426
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,440
 And one of the things that this is not suggesting, even though this has been argued this way

427
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,600
 from time to time, I don't think this is suggesting that certainly not individual churches get

428
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,840
 to do that.

429
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,360
 I don't even think it's trying to suggest that individual presbyteries get to do that,

430
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,160
 but rather that this is something that the church, again, a big C, the denomination,

431
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,800
 the union, the association of all of those particular churches has to do or gets to do,

432
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:18,920
 you might say, is entitled to do, and that we have this right to as a denomination.

433
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:24,200
 I mean, I hate to use that because that word isn't in this, but as a union of particular

434
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:33,000
 churches that we have the authority to declare those terms of admission.

435
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,800
 On the one hand, I would want to be careful that we don't suggest that we can add terms

436
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,000
 of admission into communion as a member.

437
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,600
 We can't add things that are not in scripture.

438
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,040
 Again, this is not denying what will be said later about the ministerial and declarative

439
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,520
 power of the church.

440
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:00,240
 So we cannot say you have to be a Republican to be a member of the PCA.

441
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,400
 Praise God, we can't say that.

442
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,960
 We cannot say in order to be a minister, I mean, this is actually a pretty interesting

443
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,480
 qualification that we might have to be fighting against sooner rather than later.

444
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,640
 What happens if a VCO amendment is eventually adopted where you have to do a background

445
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,360
 check and then someone decides, well, if you don't have a clear background check, you

446
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,560
 can't be a minister, even if it was 20 years ago or whatever.

447
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,680
 I'm just saying, that's not a qualification to be a minister, and so we shouldn't be adding

448
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
 that.

449
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:43,160
 But one of the things that it points out that is even if we did that, if we exercise this

450
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,880
 right, we might err, it says in making the terms of community, either too lax or too

451
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,280
 narrow.

452
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,680
 But even if we did that, we're not infringing upon the liberty or rights of others, we're

453
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,000
 only making it in proper use of our own.

454
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,960
 And that's because no one is forced, I mean, my children might disagree when they were

455
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,480
 younger, but no one's forced to be members of a PCA church.

456
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,600
 No one is forced to be a minister of a PCA church.

457
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:20,760
 If someone finds the way in which we have made the terms of community or too lax or too narrow,

458
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,560
 they don't have to belong to our church.

459
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,720
 They can disassociate and go somewhere else.

460
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,080
 And so I think there's a lot that's packed into this, but it's certainly trying to help

461
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:45,720
 us to understand who determines those terms of communion and how they are, they sort of

462
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,640
 built her down into the particular church.

463
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,480
 It's an interesting point that we sort of set up two sides of it, right, that there's

464
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,200
 the one side is that the church has to establish these things.

465
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,880
 But on the other side is that the people who choose to join are submitting to them, but

466
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,280
 only in so far as they choose to continue submitting to them, they can depart at their

467
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,640
 leisure, they're voluntarily associated.

468
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,760
 I remember sitting down with a man in the church that I served many years ago now and he looked

469
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,360
 at me and he said, I just don't like the way that the elders are running things and

470
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,640
 that the elders are elected in this particular way and that this is the way things are.

471
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,880
 And I just don't know what to do about being in a part of this church and we just need

472
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
 to change it.

473
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,680
 And I said, well, that's unfortunate.

474
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,080
 And he said, what do you suppose that I should do if I'm just so unhappy with these things?

475
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,720
 And he didn't really like what I responded to him with because what I said was that he

476
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,480
 should leave and find a church that he likes because this is the way that we do things.

477
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,880
 And he was only voluntarily associated with us.

478
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,440
 And we weren't infringing on any of his rights by being Presbyterian.

479
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,760
 We were just infringing on his preferences, I suppose, as long as he wanted to remain

480
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
 with us.

481
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,120
 Scott, you talk about some of this in your notes that you've given us about how some

482
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,720
 other traditions treat membership.

483
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,160
 Maybe you have something to say here about setting terms for admission.

484
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
 Yeah.

485
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,760
 So with church membership and it came to faith in the mainline Dutch tradition and part of

486
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,160
 your membership vows weren't merely evangelical in nature.

487
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,120
 They were reformed in nature.

488
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:22,600
 And we had to, when I made my profession of faith, I swore to uphold the three forms

489
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,000
 of unity as what I believe the scriptures teach.

490
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,120
 And I always thought that I was so unique, especially moving into the PCA where in many

491
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,720
 of our churches, there are Baptists, right?

492
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,680
 If you uphold the three forms of unity, you're not going to be a Baptist at my Dutch Reformed

493
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,880
 Church.

494
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,400
 But the PCA, at least historically, has been less stringent.

495
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,360
 And I think that's part of the voluntary communion as we were just talking.

496
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,040
 It's a little different.

497
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,880
 Baptists are often permitted to join, but they are unable to hold off.

498
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,760
 That's where the rub hits for us.

499
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,000
 And so I find it interesting how various traditions deal with this issue.

500
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,360
 It's not just you can believe whatever you want to be here.

501
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:15,880
 There are guidelines that we all make most to before God in the presence of his people.

502
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,880
 But it does remind me of a situation in my polity class in Jackson.

503
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,120
 A guy waters head, I think a rolling y'all there come give us a lecture and we were talking

504
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,080
 about church discipline and excommunication and all that.

505
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,880
 And someone asked the question of what do you do with someone who's in the middle of

506
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,240
 process who just seeks to say, I'm done.

507
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,320
 I don't want it to be a part of this body anymore and I want out.

508
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,720
 And I think the classes sentiment was, well, you continue process.

509
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,720
 But the ruling elders argument was, no, you release them.

510
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,640
 You release them from membership.

511
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,160
 Because it's voluntary.

512
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,520
 And not only that, I think its principle is more than just maybe what we're talking about

513
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:06,320
 here was you can't like civilly, the church can find lawsuits.

514
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,600
 If they pursue someone who no longer wants to volunteer be with them.

515
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:16,320
 And so I reminded of that that warning, you may want justice.

516
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,200
 And in some circumstances and for a minister, it's certainly perhaps a little different

517
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,480
 than a church member.

518
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,600
 But there is a voluntary nature that we must remind ourselves when we associate and those

519
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,200
 who associate with us.

520
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,480
 Well, there's also the civil realm.

521
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,480
 I think a preliminary principle number two also reminds us that voluntary association

522
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,440
 applies to the civil government.

523
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,520
 In some ways, this is also saying the government can't tell us who our members are and are

524
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,560
 not.

525
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:55,400
 This is, it feels a very anti-establishmentarian that this voluntary association and that we

526
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,280
 get to determine who our membership is.

527
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,640
 And so the government also on the other end can't come in and say, no, you have to have

528
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,560
 this person still as a member in your church.

529
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,920
 No, the church government gets to decide who his members are and who they are not.

530
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,160
 Let's move on to number three, which says our blessed savior for the edification of the

531
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:23,000
 visible church, which is his body has appointed officers, not only to preach the gospel and

532
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,640
 administer the sacraments, but also to exercise discipline for the preservation, both of truth

533
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
 and duty.

534
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,600
 It is incumbent upon these officers and upon the whole church and whose name they act to

535
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,760
 censure or cast out the erroneous and scandalous observing in all cases the rules contained

536
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,680
 in the word of God.

537
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,240
 Steve, start us off again.

538
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,960
 I just keep throwing to you.

539
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,400
 No, it's just because you're here.

540
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
 I'm not used to the other.

541
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,600
 I'm not used to having extra people.

542
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,080
 Talk us a little bit about here about the representative aspect of the government that

543
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,320
 this principle is setting up for us.

544
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,320
 Yeah.

545
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,360
 Well, one of the things I was thinking about and I've often thought about with this is

546
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:11,080
 a phrase, an idea that I've heard, you know, often that American civil government is based

547
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,040
 upon Presbyterianism.

548
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,360
 And I think that there are plenty of comparisons that could be made.

549
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,840
 But one of the dangers of that idea is that we do have representative government in the

550
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
 United States.

551
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,760
 So I'm in Florida, the great free state of Florida.

552
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,120
 I mean, we all elect our legislatures, but we elect them in the free state of Florida

553
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:41,160
 down here and send them off to, whether it's Tallahassee or Washington, depending upon,

554
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,200
 you know, what office they're holding.

555
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,440
 And we want them to go to those places and represent, right?

556
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,160
 They're representing our in those places of civil government.

557
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,880
 And one of the dangers in drawing a connection between the civil government is representative

558
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,120
 and the way in which we also have representatives, right?

559
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,120
 We have elders.

560
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,320
 We have elders at session, elders that go to Presbyterian elders that go to the general

561
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,160
 assembly is that it's possible.

562
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,440
 And I've certainly heard this sentiment various times in the trite that those elders are going

563
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,680
 to represent, you know, the people that elders are elected to go to session to represent

564
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,400
 the church.

565
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,120
 And that is, you know, 180 degree difference from what the biblical idea of representation

566
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:37,640
 is that elders, pastors and ruling elders are elected not to represent the people before

567
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
 God.

568
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,320
 I mean, we're not pre-ceptual.

569
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,920
 We are appointed to represent Christ to his church and say representative form of government,

570
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,720
 but it's the opposite type of representation that we typically see in American government

571
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,560
 or that we do see in American government.

572
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,800
 And so I think that's an important point for us to understand and for people to understand,

573
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
 right?

574
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:06,360
 Is this idea that officers are appointed, you know, ultimately by Christ, this gets into

575
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,160
 a lot of the doctrine of ordination that we, you know, we much later in your podcast, of

576
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,000
 course, to talk about those things.

577
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,480
 But you know, it's Christ who gifts individuals with their gifts.

578
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,920
 It's also Christ who gifts the church with those officers.

579
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,440
 And so we have to, we have to recognize that.

580
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,800
 But also there's another statement in here that I think is interesting.

581
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,560
 I think it's the second sentence that has been coming upon those officers and upon the

582
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,440
 whole church in whose name they act to censure cast out its netarot.

583
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,640
 Now, we could talk more about the other pieces, but I'm just thinking about that first phrase,

584
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,280
 the officers and upon the whole church and whose name they act, that it can all those

585
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:52,400
 sound as if the permanent principle is suggesting that by acting in the name of the church,

586
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,960
 they are in fact representing the church.

587
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:02,520
 It almost sounds a little fuzzy there, but I was looking at, I was doing my daily devotional

588
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:08,120
 in water's book, How Jesus Runs the Church, and you know, came across.

589
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:14,240
 He makes this reference to a statement that Thomas Peck makes.

590
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,720
 And he says, you know, the power of the church resides in her is exercise by the officers.

591
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:27,000
 So there's this connection between the power that the church has resides in the whole church.

592
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,440
 It's not the power of the church doesn't reside nearly in officers.

593
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,960
 It resides in the whole church, but it's exercise is carried out by the officers who

594
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,280
 were elected.

595
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,560
 And so again, that that power that Christ has given is not to merely individual to the

596
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,640
 whole church.

597
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,880
 And then it is exercise by those officers.

598
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,400
 And in one sense, we this sentence could be written a different way, right?

599
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,440
 It is incumbent upon those officers and upon, you know, who act in Christ's name.

600
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,560
 It could say that.

601
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:10,600
 But it also reminds us that that power that officers have is not given to them directly.

602
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:16,560
 It is given to them indirectly through the election of the congregation.

603
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,600
 They are ordained.

604
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:23,480
 And so even though they're gifted by Christ, no man can stand up and oh, I've had 20 people

605
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,640
 try to do this, right?

606
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,160
 Stand up and say, I'm gifted by Christ to be a teacher.

607
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,640
 You just need to make me a teacher.

608
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,040
 And that's not how the church works.

609
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,640
 You may be gifted and we may test and try those gifts.

610
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,960
 But at the end of the day, those who will teach particularly as officers that they have

611
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:48,320
 to have the the approbation of the whole of the body, which they serve.

612
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,000
 And again, that's another preliminary principle as well that we're pulling into.

613
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,640
 But that's kind of the nature of principles is that they all they all kind of weave together

614
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,160
 back and forth amongst them.

615
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,240
 So I thought that was an important point just to bring out both the representative idea,

616
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,920
 but also the way in which that power flows from Christ to to the officers in the church.

617
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,760
 Jared help walk us through this idea of officers and what they've been appointed to do.

618
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,600
 Speaking about the three marks.

619
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:24,760
 To piggyback on what Steve was saying, this seems to be not only a preliminary principle,

620
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,520
 but a charge and a challenge to the officers.

621
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,600
 When you read through this, you realize the three marks of the church are coming out here

622
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,040
 in preaching sacraments and church discipline.

623
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,000
 And these are falling on the officers that you are to maintain these things within the

624
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 church.

625
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,360
 This is a charge and a challenge.

626
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,360
 It's a grave responsibility to the elders.

627
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,200
 And they should be very serious about what they're doing.

628
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,120
 Some people, I think, approach being an officer in the church as you get this title or this.

629
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,760
 It's kind of like just an honor or it's something that you just towed around.

630
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,560
 But no, it's it's a grave responsibility.

631
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,040
 And I think preliminary principle three reminds us of that.

632
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,680
 How do we protect the offices of elder the office of elder as it relates to the temptation

633
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
 of pleasing constituencies?

634
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:23,240
 I think that's a common thing that our churches experience representing these people to this

635
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,840
 session and we got to make sure we keep them happy.

636
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:36,000
 How do we as pastors help our sessions to think differently than the civil realm as it

637
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,320
 relates to representative leadership?

638
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,240
 Yeah, I don't know necessarily how to do that.

639
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:50,400
 As you were speaking, I was thinking of an example in the church I served up in Pennsylvania

640
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:59,880
 where a one of the members of our session took a pretty unpopular opinion on a matter.

641
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,640
 And I remember having a couple of conversations with him about that.

642
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:14,960
 And one level, my thought was probably not incorrectly that there would be certain people

643
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,720
 in a congregation that they knew the position that he took that they might be very upset

644
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
 with him.

645
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,640
 And it might even be the kind of thing that might cost him an election coming up in a

646
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,640
 few years or whatever.

647
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:36,720
 And to his credit, he said, "That particular meeting at that particular decision, I had

648
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,720
 to do, I had to follow my own conscience.

649
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,680
 I had to do what I thought Christ, for her to need to do in that particular situation.

650
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,040
 I couldn't make that decision on the basis of whether or not the people back at Hillcrest

651
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,360
 would be happy or not."

652
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,520
 And I still wasn't happy with the decision he made.

653
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,160
 But I greatly appreciated the sentiment and many things in my life.

654
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,960
 I was greatly edified by his wisdom in that.

655
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,520
 And so that is an answer to your question as far as how do we inculcate that into elders

656
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:18,560
 beyond maybe telling those stories, reminding people of the importance of that, pointing

657
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,920
 people back to the fact that at the end, these are biblical concepts.

658
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:31,760
 And the last day, I'm going to have to stand up, or maybe kneel, and give an account for

659
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:39,720
 not just how I shepherd Christ's people in my particular church, but also for the ways

660
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:46,760
 in which I behaved and acted and voted in the Presbyterian General Assembly, committees,

661
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,840
 et cetera.

662
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:53,440
 And Jesus is not going to say, "Well, okay, well, the church, you were trying to please

663
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,440
 the church.

664
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,520
 Okay, he's not going to care.

665
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:02,560
 He's going to care about whether I was following his word and his law and his commandment."

666
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:11,840
 And so a lot of this is just trying to remind people of the genuine nature of that representation

667
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,200
 that we go as his ministers.

668
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:21,480
 We minister in his name, not in the name of the particular churches where we serve, even

669
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,000
 though we announce ourselves at the assembly, you know, hands, deep tips and from Gulf Coast

670
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 Presbyterian.

671
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,600
 Well, I think that's a good place for us to stop.

672
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,040
