description: Our quick first show from the Reformation Worship Conference at Midway PCA in Powder Springs, GA features our friends Sean Morris, Zack Groff, and Ryan Biese...together in the flesh (but tastefully dressed) for the first time. A great benefit of this show was to figure out that our wireless mics were failing...so we'll know better for upcoming shows.
guests:
  - Ryan Biese
  - Zach Groff
  - Sean Morris

Also, good discussion on the need for the masses in mainline and mega churches to hear the gospel.
