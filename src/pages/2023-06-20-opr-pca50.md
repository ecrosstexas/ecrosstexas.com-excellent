title: "Dr. O. Palmer Robertson's Memories of the PCA's Founding, Aspirations for Her Future"
description: "Here's an extended version (recorded the day after the assembly concluded) of Dr. O. Palmer Robertson's message to the PCA on the occasion of her 50th anniversary. Dr. Robertson had delivered a briefer version at an assembly-wide seminar on June 13, 2023. Thanks to our own Zoe Miller for recording these remarks and to Dr. Robertson for sharing them. Because of positive audience reaction, we have included introductory and concluding remarks from our host and panel (Zoe Miller, and pastors Ryan Biese and Zack Groff) as well."
