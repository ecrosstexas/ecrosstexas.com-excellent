PREFERRED COMMUNICATION CHANNELS

1) Messages.app / SMS messages are the best way to send me a quick message.
2) If I don't have your number in my contacts, you will need to leave a voicemail when calling my phone. If I know you I will add your number to Contacts.app so you pop-up next time you call.
3) I get a lot of email and sometimes things get lost, but this is best way to send me anything of substance. If I don't reply after 48 hours feel free to send me a reminder.
4) Public Mentions/DMs on Twitter will be seen daily.
5) Public Mentions/DMs on Discord will be seen at least once per week.
6) Public Mentions/DMs on Mastodon will be seen at least once per week.
7) Public Mentions/DMs on Facebook will be seen at least once per week.
8) Public Mentions/DMs on Instagram will be seen at least once per fortnight.
