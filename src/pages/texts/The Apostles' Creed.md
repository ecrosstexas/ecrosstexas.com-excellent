I believe in God the Father Almighty,  
Maker of heaven and earth.

I believe in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord;  
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary;  
suffered under Pontius Pilate;  
was crucified, dead, and buried;  
he descended into hell; third day he rose again from the dead;  
he ascended into heaven,  
and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;  
from there he shall come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit;  
the holy catholic church;  
the communion of saints;  
the forgiveness of sins;  
the resurrection of the body;  
and the life everlasting. Amen.
