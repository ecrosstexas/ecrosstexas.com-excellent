Why is it good to be a member of a Presbyterian Church? Teaching Elder, Fred Greco, of [Christ Church Katy](https://www.cckpca.org/), joins us today to answer that question and discuss Presbyterianism.   
  
We walkthrough:    
1) Why be a member of a church?    
2) Brief overview of the models of church government.    
3) Why choose a presbyterian church? (particularly conservative, confessional ones in [NAPARC](https://www.naparc.org/))    
4) How to serve Jesus in your local church.
