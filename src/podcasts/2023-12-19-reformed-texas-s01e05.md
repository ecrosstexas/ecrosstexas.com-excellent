A historic podcast with members of the Vanguard Presbyterian Church and the PCA. Ryan Denton is an open air preacher and evangelist. He also serves as the organizing pastor of church plants in Lubbock, Midland, and coming in March 2024 San Angelo. We talk about Vanguard, church planting (especially in more blue-collar areas), the need for robust theology, and open-air preaching.

Ryan is the author of five books on evangelism as well as numerous articles. He has graduate degrees from The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, St. John's College, and a Th.M from Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary. He lives in Lubbock with his wife and 3 sons.
