Man of the people, Ruling Elder, Brian Heise of Grace and Peace Presbyterian Church (PCA) in Anna, Texas joins us today. 

Learn about the history of Grace and Peace PC and Godâ€™s provision for his church. We revisit his appearance on Prebsycast at the General Assembly in 2021. Brian shares his thoughts on the state of the PCA as we talk about the need for churchmen to speak to the issues of the day. We also talk about pressures from both the left and the right on the church's mission. Through it all, Brian shares his love for the Word of God and encourages us to regularly read Holy Scripture.
