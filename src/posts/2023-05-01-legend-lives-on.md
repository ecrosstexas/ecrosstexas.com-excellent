>The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
>Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
>The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
>When the skies of November turn gloomy

With those lyrics, the incredible and haunting _The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald_ begins. 6 minutes 30 seconds of [unbelievable maritime history](https://ssedmundfitzgerald.org/) set to song.

I learned on Twitter last night that it's creator, the Canadian singer, storyteller, and songwriter, Gordon Lightfoot died today. Lightfoot had a way with words and a voice to match. What a treasure.

Fellow Canadian, Daryl Reaugh shared this:

Here's a link if you want to find the [Lightfoot documentary](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/gordon-lightfoot-if-you-could-read-my-mind).

Scott Johnson over at [Power Line](https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2023/05/gordon-lightfoot-dies-at-84.php) wrote about Lightfoot today as well highlighting a number of songs.

I love listening to his songs. _Sundow_, _If You Could Read My Mind_, _The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald_ are three of his most popular songs. What's your favorite?
