title: "Machen and the PCA Today"
description: "After all, what kind of man can 'contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints' (Jude 3) in such a way that even his ardent opponent praises him at his death for his convictions and his grace? Only one who follows in the footsteps of the King and Head of the Church, united to him in life, in death, and into glory. Perhaps, in the end, a whole-souled commitment to do just that is the greatest legacy that Machen leaves to the PCA today."
