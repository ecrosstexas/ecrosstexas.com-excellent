title: "Cultural Differences: PCA & OPC Assemblies Examined"
description: "Two OPC pastors and a PCA ruling elder and teaching elder join us to talk about the differences and similarities between two denominations 'divided by a common confession.' Jim Cassidy, Chris Drew, Joshua Torrey, and Ryan Biese were our guests. Most of us attended (or watched) at least one general assembly in the past month."
