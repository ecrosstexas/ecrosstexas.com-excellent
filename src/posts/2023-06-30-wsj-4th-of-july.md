title: "Christians Err if They Give Up on America"
description: "In a WSJ Opinion piece, D.G. Hart writes about the Christians relationship with the 4th of July."
quote: "Christian believers have good reason to celebrate the Fourthâ€”not because the country is carrying out a divine mission but rather because it makes room for people like them to practice their faith as they like. Instead of American 'greatness' stemming from conformity to Christian norms, America is 'great' because churches can thrive in it. American patriotism distinguishes the functions of government from the substance of faith, which is why it can unite believers of all kinds in celebrations of the founding."
