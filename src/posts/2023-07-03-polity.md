title: "Polity Is Spiritual"
description: "Job Dalomba writes 'Polity is inherently spiritual, and it seeks to serve the good of the church.'"
quote: "Sadly, no church polity is immune from sin. Christians are being sanctified, but are not yet glorified. This means that biblical polity’s careful implementation in the local church will not result in glorification. Wolves still enter in sheep’s clothing. The reality of sin is always with us, and in a bit of irony, that is precisely why we need church polity, and why polity is spiritual."
