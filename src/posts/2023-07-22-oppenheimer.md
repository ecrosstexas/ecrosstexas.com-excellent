J. Robert Oppenheimer was obviously conflicted by his role in development and eventual deployment of nuclear weapons.

The position paper [Christian Responsibility In The Nuclear Age](https://pcahistory.org/pca/digest/studies/1-439.pdf) was presented at the PCA's 15th General Assembly in 1987. It is worth revisiting in light of the Christopher Nolan [Oppenheimer](https://www.oppenheimermovie.com) film.
