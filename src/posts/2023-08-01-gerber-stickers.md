A huge thank you to [Scott Edburg](https://twitter.com/SEdburg), [Jacob Gerber](https://twitter.com/jacobgerber), and [Zach Groff](https://twitter.com/ZGroff) for putting this [book](/blog/jacob-gerbers-new-resource-for-presbyters/) together and sending them out as a show of thanks for helping to track the BCO Amendments as they moved through the Presbyteries.
