title: "Confronting the Fashionable Sins of the Age"
description: "John Hanna writes that Sin\u0027s God-defying, God-opposing character, in light of our mortality, the coming judgment, and eternity, is largely, if not completely, ignored."
quote: "Given that our secular age is subjective and relativistic and therapeutic, the reality of objective, transcendent truth is practically incomprehensible to our neighbors and friends, including many within our churches as well. Unless and until that is challenged clearly and directly, what is said is liable to be understood and filtered through such subjectivism and relativism. Thus, the presentation of sin as primarily psychological, interpersonal, and sociological will invariably be understood on such terms. Such sin cannot make sense of why we needed the Son of God to assume our flesh, bear our sin, plunge down into death and hell, and rise again."
