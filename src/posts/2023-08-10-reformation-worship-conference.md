After a few years hiatus, Midway's [Reformation & Worship Conference](https://midwaypca.org/church-life/ministries/reformation-worship-conference/) returns this October.  This email hit my inbox earlier today:

> Just a quick reminder to register for the upcoming Reformation & Worship Conference, to take place October 19-22, 2023 at [Midway Presbyterian Church (PCA),](https://midwaypca.org) Powder Springs, GA.
> 
> August will be gone before we know it, and you'll want to take advantage of our early registration price of $99, which includes the meal plan. After September 2, 2023, the Regular Registration rate will apply. 
> 
> We are also offering group discounts for groups of 7 or more, and a fantastic rate for College and Seminary students. Let me know if you would like additional information on these rates. Students may register online, but if you're interested in group discounts, give me a call or email (below).
> 
> So, dust off your copy of J. Gresham Machen's book "Christianity and Liberalism," and come prepared to enrich your minds and hearts as the church of the 21st Century continues the battle so eloquently outlined in Machen's 1923 classic. 
> 
> Registration is now available [online,](https://subsplash.com/midwaypresbyterianchurch/lb/ev/+8twhrj4) and the draft schedule, with more to come, is at: [https://midwaypca.org/schedule/.](https://midwaypca.org/schedule/)
