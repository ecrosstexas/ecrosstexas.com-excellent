My friend Brad Denton and his church are hosting what looks to be a wonderful conference this November:

An onrush of icy headwinds have spawned changing tides in the West. The amicable sentiment for the things of God of decades past has cooled into ambivalence, and is quickly becoming open animosity. Gone is the goodwill once extended to the true church of Christ as popular culture stridently champions evil as good, and darkness as light.

It may be a new experience to this generation, but it is not new to the Church of Christ, nor does it catch our King unawares. At Lakewood’s Fall Conference, our speakers will propose from the witness of Scripture and the history of Christ’s church how Christians might walk honorably before the Lord, each according to our station, in our glorious commission to glorify God in all things and in all ages.
