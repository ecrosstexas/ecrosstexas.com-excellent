title: "Only 12.3% have Morning & Evening Worship Services in the PCA"
description: "Justin Andrusk & Matthew Lee share comprehensive data and reflect on the prevalence of morning and evening worship in the PCA"
quote: "We cast light on this issue not to cast shame or point fingers, but because we love the evening worship service. It is a wonderful blessing of our Reformed heritage, but lamentably underutilized in the PCA today. Perhaps not every church can have both morning and evening services, but we would love to see it become as widespread as it once was."
