title: "Morning & Evening in the PCA"
description: "Justin Andrusk & Matthew Lee share comprehensive data and reflect on the prevalence of morning and evening worship in the PCA"
quote: "Perhaps one of the greatest blessings of the Christian faith is the blessing of the Lord’s Day, setting aside one day in seven to gather with God’s people for His worship. The conviction that the Lord’s Day ought to be set aside for worship is why at one time it was the near-universal practice of Reformed churches to gather for both morning and evening worship on Sundays.
Regrettably, the practice is no longer common in the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA)....only 238 of 1930 churches (12.3%) listed in the PCA directory report having both morning and evening worship services regularly."
