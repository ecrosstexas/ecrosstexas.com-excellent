I had the opportunity to lead the new member class today at Trinity speaking about _Our Theological Identity and Presbyterian Church Government._ 

> Many people have asked what we at Trinity Presbyterian Church believe.  Sometimes the questions are asked these ways: What are our _theological_ distinctives?  What does it mean to be a _Presbyterian_ Church? What does it mean to say we are _reformed_? Are these issues even _important_?  Do we, in our theological tradition, care about _evangelism_; that is, winning new people to faith in Jesus Christ?  While this document may not answer every question of this nature, as elders and under-shepherds of the flock, we do want to help members, visitors and inquirers learn more about our church.

In addition to teaching the prepared materials, I talked and shared a lot from the Preface of the BCO shared the following information:

There is a combo episode [Why Polity Matters…and Why Another Podcast?](/notes/podcasts/presbycast/why-polity-mattersand-why-another-podcast/) that would be a good starter.
