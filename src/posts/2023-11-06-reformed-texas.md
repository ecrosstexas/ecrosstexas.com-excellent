The arrival of new podcasts seems never ending. In the case of Reformed podcasts some may wonder if we are reaching a saturation point. Considering the relatively small portion of the population that would hold to a Calvinistic understanding of salvation, let alone actual members in a [NAPARC](https://www.naparc.org/) church, they might have a point, but that doesn’t stop book publishers, does it? It is in these waters that I present to you a new podcast [_Presbyterian and Reformed Texas_](https://www.reformedtexas.com/) targeting an even smaller niche market.

Texas has more than 200 megachurches (churches with more than 2,000 members), yet there are approximately only 110 churches in NAPARC denominations serving a population exceeding 27 million and growing every day. acts and operates like an independent country and that theme carries over when it comes to religion. Roman Catholicism has dominated the history of Texas from it’s earliest days, but Baptist, Pentecostal, and non-denominational churches draw the largest numbers. Dallas Theological Seminary and the dispensationalism it championed in America dominates much of evangelicalism across the nation.

I love talking about the faith, the church, and other churchmen, so why not just start recording and sharing the conversations? What are the goals for this podcast?

- Encourage Presbyterian & Reformed (NAPARC) churches in Texas.
- Help more Texans (and those coming to Texas) become familiar with our churches.
- Help everyone become familiar with our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
