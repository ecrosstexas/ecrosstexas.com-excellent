The never disappointing, always entertaining, ever telling it like it is, [SEC Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/@SECShorts) crew revisits the hiring of Jimbo Fisher.  

I'll admit I drank too much Kool-Aid and thought Jimbo could bring a title to Aggieland.  He had more than enough talent, it was all just an execution issue right?

I wonder if Hope makes an appearance after we hire the next Fightin' Texas Aggies head coach.
