The Presbyterian Church in America celebrates its 50th anniversary today. I have been fortunate to call the PCA home since 2011 and serve as a Ruling Elder since 2018. The impact this denomination has had on my life and the life of my family cannot be overstated. I am thankful for Richey Goodrich for being a faithful friend of 20 plus years that led us to the PCA. I am thankful for Michael Wichlan who counseled me as I brought my family to [Trinity.](https://www.trinityplano.org/). I am thankful for my pastors Jeff Morrow and Jacob Yohannan as they lead and shepherd us today. I am thankful for the brothers who have served on the Session with me along with those on the Diaconate. I am thankful for the members who call Trinity home and freely give of their time, talents, and treasures.  

I am thankful for Andrew Simmons who got me started serving with the youth at Trinity, Felipe do Vale, and now Colton Brewer who have all poured into the lives of my children.

I am thankful for the brothers throughout the [North Texas Presbytery](https://www.ntpresbytery.org) including Matt Wood, Mark Trigsted, Brad Denton, Ben Thompson, Brian Heise, Hamid Hatami, Drew Pressoir, and so many more. I am thankful for [RUF](https://ruf.org/ministry/texas-am-university/), the Coleman, Anderson, and Triolo families, and everyone else at [Westminster Bryan.](https://wpcbryan.org) I am thankful for Ralph LaGuardia and the people of [Fairfield Presbyterian](https://fairfieldpca.com) in Pensacola, Florida who welcome me in one Sunday a year. I am thankful for brothers across the denomination who warmly welcomed me both online and in-person&mdash;O. Palmer Robertson, Fred Greco, Brad Isbell, Job Dalomba, Seth and Zoe Miller, Zachary Groff, Sean and Sarah Morris, Stephen Spinnenweber, Joshua Torrey, and Jared Nelson just to name a few.

Is it perfect? No. But I'm also thankful to be part of a group of brothers (and sisters) working to make it better while maintaining unity. It's so easy to walk away today when you disagree instead of staying and working. I pray that Christ is glorified in the work of his imperfect people and that He will be faithful to grow and mature his church.

Although I'm slightly older than the PCA, I share David Strain's thoughts:
> No doubt, the PCA at 50 still has a long way to go as we strive to be "faithful to the Scriptures, true to the Reformed faith, and obedient to the Great Commission," as our motto says. There are differences of opinion among us on the nature of the church's mission. We still must learn how best to welcome, reflect, and celebrate the rich diversity of ethnicity, culture, and experience found in the communities we seek to reach for Christ. Like other evangelicals, we're struggling to respond effectively to growing biblical illiteracy, pragmatism, progressivism, and Christian nationalism.

> But, on the cusp of 50 myself, I rejoice over the PCA at 50: a confessional, connectional, missional church with whom Christ, the King and Head of the church, is far from finished.
