title: "Did Machen struggle with a same-sex attraction?"
description: "R. Scott Clark writes about modern attempts to paint J. Gresham Machen as same-sex attracted."
quote: "One of the more distasteful and lazy interpretative moves that scholars have made, in our sexually libertine age, is to anachronistically sexualize earlier expressions of masculine affection as sexual. Among Reformed figures it has been done to Theodore Beza, and now Machenâ€™s expressions of affection for male friends has been sexualized. As difficult as it may be to believe now, in our hyper-sexualized age, there was a time not very long ago when men expressed affection for other men without the thought or hint of sexual attraction."
