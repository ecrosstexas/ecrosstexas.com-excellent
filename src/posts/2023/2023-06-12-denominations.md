description: "Ryan Burge takes a deep dive into the trajectory of nine denominations."
quote: "There are two traditions that are up. The Assemblies of God has grown by over 50% in the thirty-five years. The PCA has doubled in size, as well. But itâ€™s important to put that PCA number in perspective. Even today, there are only about 400,000 members. For every PCA in the United States there are about 33 Southern Baptists."
