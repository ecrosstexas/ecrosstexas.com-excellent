quote: "While there is no biblical mandate for evening worship, there is a clear “morning and evening” rhythm established in Scripture. It is not insignificant that the God who bids us “remember the Sabbath day” (Exodus 20:8) regards “a day” as an “evening and… morning” (Genesis 1:5)."

- [Lakewood Dallas](https://www.lakewoodpres.com/)
- [Redeemer McKinney](http://www.redeemermckinney.com/)

What's keep churches from holding evening services?

[Justin Andrusk](https://andrusk.com) and [Matthew Lee](https://matthewhlee.org) are busy [compiling this data](https://gitlab.com/Jandrusk/pca/-/tree/main/data) for all 88 Presbyteries in the PCA.

Updated 2023-09-12: _Somehow, Bethel's evening service was missed during my initial research. My apologies to everyone._
