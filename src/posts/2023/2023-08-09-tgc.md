For an organization that is all about the gospel it appears that TGC has lost sight of the big picture. They look more and more like seeker-sensitive churches pushing [worshiptainment](/tag/worshiptainment).  How long until we say The Gospel Coalition, like the Dude, [abides?](https://dictionarykiwi.com/2016/10/17/the-dude-abides-what-does-abide-mean-in-that-context/)

While we have The Big Lebowski on our minds, [@Presbycast](https://twitter.com/presbycast/) reminds us that we need more Psalms in our churches today.
