title: "Only 12.3% have Morning & Evening Worship Services in the PCA"
description: "Justin Andrusk & Matthew Lee share comprehensive data and reflect on the prevalence of morning and evening worship in the PCA"
quote: "We cast light on this issue not to cast shame or point fingers, but because we love the evening worship service. It is a wonderful blessing of our Reformed heritage, but lamentably underutilized in the PCA today. Perhaps not every church can have both morning and evening services, but we would love to see it become as widespread as it once was."

The North Texas Presbytery currently has 5 of 39 churches (12.8%) having both morning and evening worship services regularly, so we are just over the average of the denomination where 238 of 1930 churches (12.3%) offer both.

Those churches in the NTP are:

- [Redeemer Amarillo](http://www.redeemeramarillo.com/)
- [Bethel Church Dallas](http://bethelchurchpca.org)
- [Lakewood Dallas](https://www.lakewoodpres.com/)
- [Redeemer McKinney](http://www.redeemermckinney.com/)
- [Fifth Street Tyler](http://www.fifthstreetpca.org/)


Updated 2023-09-12: _Somehow, Bethel's evening service was missed during my initial research. My apologies to everyone._
