description: "Over the last few years, various big names within Christianity have embraced what is commonly known as 'Side B Christianity' - simultaneously condemning same-sex activity whilst also claiming that same-sex attraction is morally neutral. Figures within this movement include Justin Lee, Sam Allberry, The Revoice Conference, Robert Gagnon, Wesley Hill and more. But what if sanctification doesn't stop merely in our actions but also impacts our desires?"
