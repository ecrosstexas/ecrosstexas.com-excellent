title: "Can Christians attend Gay Weddings?"
description: "Over at First Things Carl Trueman answers the question of the day 'Can Christians attend Gay Weddings?'"
quote: "In short, attending a gay wedding involves remaining silent when one should speak. It involves a concession on bodily sex that undermines any attempt to hold fast to the importance of the biological distinction between men and women. And it involves approving of a ceremony that makes a mockery of a central New Testament teaching and of Christ himself. That’s a very high price tag for avoiding hurting someone’s feelings. And if Christians still think it worth paying, the future of the church is bleak indeed."
