Dr. Rod Rosenbladt, affectionately known as "Dad Rod", entered eternal glory today.

I loved listening to those classic White Horse Inn shows with Mike Horton, Kim Riddlebarger, Ken Jones, and Rod Rosebladt. Always ready to offer the Lutheran take and faithfully proclaim Christ.  Those were the gold old days.

Rod’s talk, “The Gospel For Those Broken By The Church” has been a benefit to a countless number. If you haven't heard it, please spend some time and watch:
