As mentioned during my update on the work of the 155th meeting of the North Texas Presbytery, the Presbytery voted to have the Stated Clerk send PCA's "Humble Petition" to Protect Children from gender reassignment treatments and surgeries to our elected state officials.

The "[Humble Petition](https://byfaithonline.com/general-assembly-commission-petitions-government-officials-to-protect-children/)" stems from the work of the 50th General Assembly.

Hear from one of the commissioners, [TE Nathan Newman](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/westminsterstandard/episodes/26--TE-Nathan-Newman--the-PCAs-Humble-Petition-to-Protect-Children-e2fvaf8/a-aavrche) on _The Westminster Standard_ podcast.

Also, George Sayour recently covered this as well on the [_Presbyterian & Reformed Churchmen_](https://overcast.fm/+-HC2RfhgY) podcast.

While agreeing with the message, some within the PCA and the broader NAPARC-world have different thoughts on the use of WCF 31-4 in making such statements.  R.
