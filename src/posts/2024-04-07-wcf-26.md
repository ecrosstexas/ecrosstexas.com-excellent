## Chapter 26

### Section 1

All Saints, that are united to Jesus Christ their head, by his Spirit, and by faith, have fellowship with him in his graces, sufferings, death, resurrection, and glory: and, being united to one another in love, they have communion in each other’s gifts and graces, and are obliged to the performance of such duties, public and private, as do conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward man.

### Section 2

Saints by profession, are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and communion in the worship of God, and in performing such other spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification; as also, in relieving each other in outward things, according to their several ­abilities, and necessities. Which communion, as God offers opportunity, is to be extended unto all those, who, in every place, call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.

### Section 3

This communion which the saints have with Christ, does not make them, in any wise, partakers of the substance of his Godhead; or, to be equal with Christ, in any respect: either of which to affirm, is impious, and blasphemous. Nor does their communion one with another, as saints, take away, or infringe the title, or propriety which each man has in his goods and possessions.
