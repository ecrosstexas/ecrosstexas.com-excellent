title: "Lament over Jesus Calling"
description: "Benjamin Inman calls on the PCA to own our error with Jesus Calling."
quote: "We knew the Jesus Calling thing was whack, but we also knew the Second Commandment isn't really a problem for discerning (i.e., Reformed) people like us. How we managed to act so stupidly without active consultation and coordination-- that deserves pondering. For the moment, and to orient ourselves for anything next and wholesome: let's own it. We, the PCA, sent into evangelicalism and the world at large the most influential and popular evangelical graven image in our lifetime. We were not faithful."
