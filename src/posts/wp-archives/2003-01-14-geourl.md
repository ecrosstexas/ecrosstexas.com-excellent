Tweaking a bit more, I have added [Geo Tags](http://geotags.com/) to the `<head>` section of this web page. Why? [GeoURL](http://www.geourl.org/), provides a location-to-URL reverse directory:

> This will allow you to find URLs by their proximity to a given location. Find your neighbor's blog, perhaps, or the web page of the restaurants near you.

Who are my [neighbors](http://geourl.org/near/?p=https://www.ecrosstexas.com/blog/)?
